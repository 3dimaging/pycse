* Overview
This is a collection of examples of using python in the kinds of scientific and engineering computations I have used in classes and research. They are organized by topics.

* Basic python usage
** TODO http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/09/26/some-basic-data-structures-in-matlab/
** Basic math
Python is a basic calculator out of the box. Here we consider the most basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponenetiation. we use the func:print to get the output. For now we consider integers and float numbers. An integer is a plain number like 0, 10 or -2345. A float number has a decimal in it. The following are all floats: 1.0, -9., and 3.56. Note the trailing zero is not required, although it is good style.

#+BEGIN_SRC python 
print 2 + 4
print 8.1 - 5
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 6
: 3.1

Multiplication is equally straightforward.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
print 5 * 4
print 3.1*2
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 20
: 6.2

Division is almost as straightforward, but we have to remember that integer division is not the same as float division. Let us consider float division first.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print 4.0 / 2.0
print 1.0/3.1
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.0
: 0.322580645161

Now, consider the integer versions:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print 4 / 2
print 1/3
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2
: 0

The first result is probably what you expected, but the second may come as a surprise. In integer division the remainder is discarded, and the result is an integer. 

Exponentiation is also a basic math operation that python supports directly.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print 3.**2
print 3**2
print 2**0.5
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 9.0
: 9
: 1.41421356237

Other types of mathematical operations require us to import functionality from python libraries. We consider those in the next section.

** Advanced mathematical operators
The primary library we will consider is mod:numpy, which provides many mathematical functions, statistics as well as support for linear algebra. For a complete listing of the functions available, see http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.math.html. We begin with the simplest functions.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
print np.sqrt(2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 1.41421356237

*** Exponential and logarithmic functions
Here is the exponential function.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
print np.exp(1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.71828182846

There are two logarithmic functions commonly used, the natural log function func:numpy.log and the base10 logarithm func:numpy.log10.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
print np.log(10)
print np.log10(10)  # base10
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.30258509299
: 1.0

There are many other intrinsic functions available in mod:numpy which we will eventually cover. First, we need to consider how to create our own functions.

** Creating your own functions
We can combine operations to evaluate complex equations. Consider the value of the equation $x^3 - \log(x)$ for the value $x=4.1$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
x = 3
print x**3 - np.log(x)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 25.9013877113

It would be tedious to type this out each time. Next, we learn how to express this equation as a new function, which we can call with different values.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
def f(x):
    return x**3 - np.log(x)

print f(3)
print f(5.1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 25.9013877113
: 131.02175946

It may not seem like we did much there, but this is the foundation for solving equations in the future. Before we get to solving equations, we have a few more details to consider. Next, we consider evaluating functions on arrays of values. 
** Defining functions in python

Compare what's here to the [[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/08/09/where-its-i-got-two-turntables-and-a-microphone/][Matlab implementation. ]]

We often need to make functions in our codes to do things. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
def f(x):
    "return the inverse square of x"
    return 1.0 / x**2

print f(3)
print f([4,5])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 
: ... ... >>> 0.111111111111
: Traceback (most recent call last):
:   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
:   File "<stdin>", line 3, in f
: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'list' and 'int'

Note that functions are not automatically vectorized. There are a few ways to achieve that. One is to "cast" the input variables to objects that support vectorized operations, such as numpy.array objects.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    "return the inverse square of x"
    x = np.array(x)
    return 1.0 / x**2

print f(3)
print f([4,5])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 
: >>> ... ... ... ... >>> 0.111111111111
: [ 0.0625  0.04  ]

It is possible to have more than one variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

def func(x, y):
    "return product of x and y"
    return x * y

print func(2, 3)
print func(np.array([2, 3]), np.array([3, 4]))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 6
: [ 6 12]

You can define "lambda" functions, which are also known as inline or anonymous functions. The syntax is =lambda var:f(var)=. I think these are hard to read and discourage their use. Here is a typical usage where you have to define a simple function that is passed to another function, e.g. scipy.integrate.quad to perform an integral.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import quad
print quad(lambda x:x**3, 0 ,2)

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: (4.0, 4.440892098500626e-14)

It is possible to nest functions inside of functions like this.
#+BEGIN_SRC python

def wrapper(x):
    a = 4
    def func(x, a):
        return a * x

    return func(x, a)

print wrapper(4)

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 16

An alternative approach is to "wrap" a function, say to fix a parameter. You might do this so you can integrate the wrapped function, which depends on only a single variable, whereas the original function depends on two variables.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def func(x, a):
        return a * x
 
def wrapper(x):
    a = 4
    return func(x, a)

print wrapper(4)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 16

Last example, defining a function for an ode

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import odeint
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

k = 2.2
def myode(t,y):
    "ode defining exponential growth"
    return k * t

y0 = 3
tspan = np.linspace(0,1)
y =  odeint(myode, y0, tspan)

plt.plot(tspan, y)
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.savefig('images/funcs-ode.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

[[./images/funcs-ode.png]]

** Functions on arrays of values
It is common to evaluate a function for a range of values. Let us consider the value of the function $f(x) = \cos(x)$ over the range of $0 < x < \pi$. We cannot consider every value in that range, but we can consider say 10 points in the range. The func:numpy.linspace conveniently creates an array of values.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
print np.linspace(0, np.pi, 10)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [ 0.          0.34906585  0.6981317   1.04719755  1.3962634   1.74532925
:   2.0943951   2.44346095  2.7925268   3.14159265]

The main point of using the mod:numpy functions is that they work element-wise on elements of an array. In this example, we compute the $\cos(x)$ for each element of $x$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
x = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 10)
print np.cos(x)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [ 1.          0.93969262  0.76604444  0.5         0.17364818 -0.17364818
:  -0.5        -0.76604444 -0.93969262 -1.        ]

You can already see from this output that there is a root to the equation $\cos(x) = 0$, because there is a change in sign in the output. This is not a very convenient way to view the results; a graph would be better.  We use mod:matplotlib to make figures. Here is an example.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 10)
plt.plot(x, np.cos(x))
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('cos(x)')
plt.savefig('images/plot-cos.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

[[./images/plot-cos.png]]

This figure illustrates graphically what the numbers above show. The function crosses zero at approximately $x = 1.5$. To get a more precise value, we must actually solve the function numerically. We use the function func:scipy.optimize.fsolve to do that. More precisely, we want to solve the equation $f(x) = \cos(x) = 0$. We create a function that defines that equation, and then use func:scipy.optimize.fsolve to solve it.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.optimize import fsolve 
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    return np.cos(x)

sol, = fsolve(f, x0=1.5) # the comma after sol makes it return a float
print sol
print np.pi / 2
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 1.57079632679
: 1.57079632679

We know the solution is \pi/2. 
** Advanced function creation
Python has some nice features in creating functions. You can create default values for variables, have optional variables and optional keyword variables.
In this function f(a,b), =a= and =b= are called positional arguments, and they are required, and must be provided in the same order as the function defines.

If we provide a default value for an argument, then the argument is called a keyword argument, and it becomes optional. You can combine positional arguments and keyword arguments, but positional arguments must come first. Here is an example.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def func(a, n=2):
    "compute the nth power of a"
    return a**n

# three different ways to call the function
print func(2)
print func(2, 3)
print func(2, n=4)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 4
: 8
: 16

In the first call to the function, we only define the argument =a=, which is a mandatory, positional argument. In the second call, we define =a= and =n=, in the order they are defined in the function. Finally, in the third call, we define =a= as a positional argument, and =n= as a keyword argument.

If all of the arguments are optional, we can even call the function with no arguments. If you give arguments as positional arguments, they are used in the order defined in the function. If you use keyword arguments, the order is arbitrary.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def func(a=1, n=2):
    "compute the nth power of a"
    return a**n

# three different ways to call the function
print func()
print func(2, 4)
print func(n=4, a=2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 1
: 16
: 16

It is occasionally useful to allow an arbitrary number of arguments in a function. Suppose we want a function that can take an arbitrary number of positional arguments and return the sum of all the arguments. We use the syntax =*args= to indicate arbitrary positional arguments. Inside the function the variable =args= is a tuple containing all of the arguments passed to the function. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def func(*args):
    sum = 0
    for arg in args:
        sum += arg
    return sum

print func(1, 2, 3, 4)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 10

A more "functional programming" version of the last function is given here. This is an advanced approach that is less readable to new users, but more compact and likely more efficient for large numbers of arguments.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import operator
def func(*args):
    return reduce(operator.add, args)
print func(1, 2, 3, 4)

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 10

It is possible to have arbitrary keyword arguments. This is a common pattern when you call another function within your function that takes keyword arguments. We use =**kwargs= to indicate that arbitrary keyword arguments can be given to the function. Inside the function, kwargs is variable containing a dictionary of the keywords and values passed in.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def func(**kwargs):
    for kw in kwargs:
        print '{0} = {1}'.format(kw, kwargs[kw])

func(t1=6, color='blue')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: color = blue
: t1 = 6

A typical example might be:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def myplot(x, y, fname=None, **kwargs):
    "make plot of x,y. save to fname if not None. provide kwargs to plot"
    plt.plot(x, y, **kwargs)
    plt.xlabel('X')
    plt.ylabel('Y')
    plt.title('My plot')
    if fname:
        plt.savefig(fname)
    else:
        plt.show()

x = [1, 3, 4, 5]
y = [3, 6, 9, 12]

myplot(x, y, 'images/myfig.png', color='orange', marker='s')

# you can use a dictionary as kwargs
d = {'color':'magenta',
     'marker':'d'}

myplot(x, y, 'images/myfig2.png', **d)

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

[[./images/myfig.png]]

[[./images/myfig2.png]]

In that example we wrap the matplotlib plotting commands in a function, which we can call the way we want to, with arbitrary optional arguments. In this example, you cannot pass keyword arguments that are illegal to the plot command or you will get an error.

It is possible to combine all the options at once. I admit it is hard to imagine where this would be really useful, but it can be done!
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

def func(a, b=2, *args, **kwargs):
    "return a**b + sum(args) and print kwargs"
    for kw in kwargs:
        print 'kw: {0} = {1}'.format(kw, kwargs[kw])

    return a**b + np.sum(args)

print func(2, 3, 4, 5, mysillykw='hahah')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: kw: mysillykw = hahah
: 17

** Controlling the format of printed variables

This was first worked out in this [[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/10/06/sprintfing-to-the-finish/][original Matlab post]].

Often you will want to control the way a variable is printed. You may want to only show a few decimal places, or print in scientific notation, or embed the result in a string. Here are some examples of printing with no control over the format.
 
#+BEGIN_SRC python
a = 2./3
print a
print 1/3
print 1./3.
print 10.1
print "Avogadro's number is ", 6.022e23,'.'
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.666666666667
: 0
: 0.333333333333
: 10.1
: Avogadro's number is  6.022e+23 .

There is no control over the number of decimals, or spaces around a printed number. 

In python, we use the format function to control how variables are printed. With the format function you use codes like {/n/:format specifier} to indicate that a formatted string should be used. /n/ is the /n^{th}/ argument passed to format, and there are a variety of format specifiers. Here we examine how to format float numbers. The specifier has the general form "w.df" where w is the width of the field, and d is the number of decimals, and f indicates a float number. "1.3f" means to print a float number with 3 decimal places. Here is an example.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print 'The value of 1/3 to 3 decimal places is {0:1.3f}'.format(1./3.)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The value of 1/3 to 3 decimal places is 0.333

In that example, the 0 in {0:1.3f} refers to the first (and only) argument to the format function. If there is more than one argument, we can refer to them like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print 'Value 0 = {0:1.3f}, value 1 = {1:1.3f}, value 0 = {0:1.3f}'.format(1./3., 1./6.)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Value 0 = 0.333, value 1 = 0.167, value 0 = 0.333

Note you can refer to the same argument more than once, and in arbitrary order within the string.

Suppose you have a list of numbers you want to print out, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
for x in [1./3., 1./6., 1./9.]:
    print 'The answer is {0:1.2f}'.format(x)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The answer is 0.33
: The answer is 0.17
: The answer is 0.11

The "g" format specifier is a general format that can be used to indicate a precision, or to indicate significant digits. To print a number with a specific number of significant digits we do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print '{0:1.3g}'.format(1./3.)
print '{0:1.3g}'.format(4./3.)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.333
: 1.33

We can also specify plus or minus signs. Compare the next two outputs.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
for x in [-1., 1.]: 
    print '{0:1.2f}'.format(x)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: -1.00
: 1.00

You can see the decimals do not align. That is because there is a minus sign in front of one number. We can specify to show the sign for positive and negative numbers, or to pad positive numbers to leave space for positive numbers.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
for x in [-1., 1.]: 
    print '{0:+1.2f}'.format(x) # explicit sign

for x in [-1., 1.]: 
    print '{0: 1.2f}'.format(x) # pad positive numbers
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: -1.00
: +1.00
: -1.00
:  1.00

We use the "e" or "E" format modifier to specify scientific notation.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
eps = np.finfo(np.double).eps
print eps
print '{0}'.format(eps)
print '{0:1.2f}'.format(eps)
print '{0:1.2e}'.format(eps)  #exponential notation
print '{0:1.2E}'.format(eps)  #exponential notation with capital E
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.22044604925e-16
: 2.22044604925e-16
: 0.00
: 2.22e-16
: 2.2E-16

As a float with 2 decimal places, that very small number is practically equal to 0.

We can even format percentages. Note you do not need to put the % in your string.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
print 'the fraction {0} corresponds to {0:1.0%}'.format(0.78) 
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: the fraction 0.78 corresponds to 78%

There are many other options for formatting strings. See http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstrings for a full specification of the options.

** Advanced string formatting

   :END:
There are several more advanced ways to include formatted values in a string. In the previous case we examined replacing format specifiers by /positional/ arguments in the format command. We can instead use /keyword/ arguments. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python
s = 'The {speed} {color} fox'.format(color='brown', speed='quick')
print s
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The quick brown fox

If you have a lot of variables already defined in a script, it is convenient to use them in string formatting with the locals command:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
speed = 'slow'
color= 'blue'

print 'The {speed} {color} fox'.format(**locals())
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The slow blue fox

If you want to access attributes on an object, you can specify them directly in the format identifier.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
class A:
    def __init__(self, a, b, c):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b
        self.c = c

mya = A(3,4,5)

print 'a = {obj.a}, b = {obj.b}, c = {obj.c:1.2f}'.format(obj=mya)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: a = 3, b = 4, c = 5.00

You can access values of a dictionary:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
d = {'a': 56, "test":'woohoo!'}

print "the value of a in the dictionary is {obj[a]}. It works {obj[test]}".format(obj=d)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: the value of a in the dictionary is 56. It works woohoo!.

And, you can access elements of a list. Note, however you cannot use -1 as an index in this case.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
L = [4, 5, 'cat']

print 'element 0 = {obj[0]}, and the last element is {obj[2]}'.format(obj=L)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: element 0 = 4, and the last element is cat

There are three different ways to "print" an object. If an object has a __format__ function, that is the default used in the format command. It may be helpful to use the =str= or =repr= of an object instead. We get this with !s for =str= and !r for =repr=.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
class A:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a = a; self.b = b

    def __format__(self, format):
        s = 'a={{0:{0}}} b={{1:{0}}}'.format(format)
        return s.format(self.a, self.b)

    def __str__(self):
        return 'str: class A, a={0} b={1}'.format(self.a, self.b)

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'representing: class A, a={0}, b={1}'.format(self.a, self.b)

mya = A(3, 4)

print '{0}'.format(mya)   # uses __format__
print '{0!s}'.format(mya) # uses __str__
print '{0!r}'.format(mya) # uses __repr__
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: a=3 b=4
: str: class A, a=3 b=4
: representing: class A, a=3, b=4

This covers the majority of string formatting requirements I have come across. If there are more sophisticated needs, they can be met with various string templating python modules. the one I have used most is [[http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/][Cheetah]].
** Indexing vectors and arrays in Python

There are times where you have a lot of data in a vector or array and you want to extract a portion of the data for some analysis. For example, maybe you want to plot column 1 vs column 2, or you want the integral of data between x = 4 and x = 6, but your vector covers 0 < x < 10. Indexing is the way to do these things.

A key point to remember is that in python array/vector indices start at 0. Unlike Matlab, which uses parentheses to index a array, we use brackets in python.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 10)
print x

print x[0]  # first element
print x[2]  # third element
print x[-1] # last element
print x[-2] # second to last element

We can select a range of elements too. The syntax a:b extracts the a^{th} to (b-1)^{th} elements. The syntax a:b:n starts at a, skips nelements up to the index b.

Suppose we want the part of the vector where x > 2. We could do that by inspection, but there is a better way. We can create a mask of boolean (0 or 1) values that specify whether x > 2 or not, and then use the mask as an index.

You can use this to analyze subsections of data, for example to integrate the function y = sin(x) where x > 2.

Python does not have the linear assignment method like Matlab does. You can achieve something like that as follows. We flatten the array to 1D, do the linear assignment, and reshape the result back to the 2D array.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
c = b.flatten()
c[2] = 34
b[:] = c.reshape(b.shape)
print b

*** Summary
The most common place to use indexing is probably when a function returns an array with the independent variable in column 1 and solution in column 2, and you want to plot the solution. Second is when you want to analyze one part of the solution. There are also applications in numerical methods, for example in assigning values to the elements of a matrix or vector.

** Creating arrays in python
Often, we will have a set of 1-D arrays, and we would like to construct a 2D array with those vectors as either the rows or columns of the array. This may happen because we have data from different sources we want to combine, or because we organize the code with variables that are easy to read, and then want to combine the variables. Here are examples of doing that to get the vectors as the columns.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

print np.column_stack([a, b])

# this means stack the arrays vertically, e.g. on top of each other
print np.vstack([a, b]).T
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [[1 4]
:  [2 5]
:  [3 6]]
: [[1 4]
:  [2 5]
:  [3 6]]

Or rows:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

print np.row_stack([a, b])

# this means stack the arrays vertically, e.g. on top of each other
print np.vstack([a, b])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [[1 2 3]
:  [4 5 6]]
: [[1 2 3]
:  [4 5 6]]

The opposite operation is to extract the rows or columns of a 2D array into smaller arrays. We might want to do that to extract a row or column from a calculation for further analysis, or plotting for example. There are splitting functions in numpy. They are somewhat confusing, so we examine some examples. The numpy.hsplit command splits an array "horizontally". The best way to think about it is that the "splits" move horizontally across the array. In other words, you draw a vertical split, move over horizontally, draw another vertical split, etc... You must specify the number of splits that you want, and the array must be evenly divisible by the number of splits.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 5], 
              [4, 5, 6, 9]])

# split into two parts
p1, p2 = np.hsplit(A, 2)
print p1
print p2

#split into 4 parts
p1, p2, p3, p4 = np.hsplit(A, 4)
print p1
print p2
print p3
print p4
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
[[1 2]
 [4 5]]
[[3 5]
 [6 9]]
[[1]
 [4]]
[[2]
 [5]]
[[3]
 [6]]
[[5]
 [9]]
#+end_example

In the numpy.vsplit command the "splits" go "vertically" down the array. Note that the split commands return 2D arrays.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 5], 
              [4, 5, 6, 9]])

# split into two parts
p1, p2 = np.vsplit(A, 2)
print p1
print p2
print p2.shape
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [[1 2 3 5]]
: [[4 5 6 9]]
: (1, 4)

An alternative approach is array unpacking. In this example, we unpack the array into two variables. The array unpacks by row.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 5], 
              [4, 5, 6, 9]])

# split into two parts
p1, p2 = A
print p1
print p2
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1 2 3 5]
: [4 5 6 9]

To get the columns, just transpose the array.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 5], 
              [4, 5, 6, 9]])

# split into two parts
p1, p2, p3, p4 = A.T
print p1
print p2
print p3
print p4
print p4.shape
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1 4]
: [2 5]
: [3 6]
: [5 9]
: (2,)

Note that now, we have 1D arrays.

You can also access rows and columns by indexing. We index an array by [row, column]. To get a row, we specify the row number, and all the columns in that row like this [row, :]. Similarly, to get a column, we specify that we want all rows in that column like this: [:, column]. This approach is useful when you only want a few columns or rows.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 5], 
              [4, 5, 6, 9]])

# get row 1
print A[1]
print A[1, :]  # row 1, all columns

print A[:, 2]  # get third column 
print A[:, 2].shape
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [4 5 6 9]
: [4 5 6 9]
: [3 6]
: (2,)

Note that even when we specify a column, it is returned as a 1D array.

* Math
** Numeric derivatives by differences
numpy has a function called numpy.diff() that is similar to the one found in matlab. It calculates the differences between the elements in your list, and returns a list that is one element shorter, which makes it unsuitable for plotting the derivative of a function.

Loops in python are pretty slow (relatively speaking) but they are usually trivial to understand. In this script we show some simple ways to construct derivative vectors using loops. It is implied in these formulas that the data points are equally spaced. If they are not evenly spaced, you need a different approach.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

These are the brainless way to calculate numerical derivatives. They
work well for very smooth data. they are surprisingly fast even up to

x = np.linspace(0.78,0.79,100)
y = np.sin(x)
dy_analytical = np.cos(x)
'''
lets use a forward difference method:
that works up until the last point, where there is not
a forward difference to use. there, we use a backward difference.
'''

tf1 = time.time()
dyf = [0.0]*len(x)

#set last element by backwards difference
dyf[-1] = (y[-1] - y[-2])/(x[-1] - x[-2])

print ' Forward difference took %1.1f seconds' % (time.time() - tf1)

'''and now a backwards difference'''
tb1 = time.time()

    dyb[i] = (y[i] - y[i-1])/(x[i]-x[i-1])

print ' Backward difference took %1.1f seconds' % (time.time() - tb1)

print ' Centered difference took %1.1f seconds' % (time.time() - tc1)

** 2-point vs. 4-point numerical derivatives
If your data is very noisy, you will have a hard time getting good derivatives; derivatives tend to magnify noise. In these cases, you have to employ smoothing techniques, either implicitly by using a multipoint derivative formula, or explicitly by smoothing the data yourself, or taking the derivative of a function that has been fit to the data in the neighborhood you are interested in.

Here is an example of a 4-point centered difference of some noisy data:
#+BEGIN_SRC python

Adapted from http://biomedicalcomputationreview.org/2/3/8.pdf and
http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=838250.838251

This posts introduces a novel way to numerically estimate the derivative
of a function that does not involve finite difference schemes. Finite
difference schemes are approximations to derivatives that become more and
more accurate as the step size goes to zero, except that as the step size
approaches the limits of machine accuracy, new errors can appear in the
approximated results. In the references above, a new way to compute the
derivative is presented that does not rely on differences!

The new way is: $f'(x) = \rm{imag}(f(x + i\Delta x)/\Delta x)$ where the
function $f$ is evaluated in imaginary space with a small $\Delta x$ in
the complex plane. The derivative is miraculously equal to the imaginary
part of the result in the limit of $\Delta x \rightarrow 0$!

This example comes from the first link. The derivative must be evaluated
using the chain rule.  We compare a forward difference, central
difference and complex-step derivative approximations.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def f(x):   return np.sin(3*x)*np.log(x)

x = 0.7
h = 1e-7

# analytical derivative
dfdx_a = 3 * np.cos( 3*x)*np.log(x) + np.sin(3*x) / x

# finite difference
dfdx_fd = (f(x + h) - f(x))/h

# central difference
dfdx_cd = (f(x+h)-f(x-h))/(2*h)

# complex method
dfdx_I = np.imag(f(x + np.complex(0, h))/h)

print dfdx_a
print dfdx_fd
print dfdx_cd
print dfdx_cd

These are all the same to 4 decimal places. The simple finite difference is the least accurate, and the central differences is practically the same as the complex number approach.

Let us use this method to verify the fundamental Theorem of Calculus, i.e.
to evaluate the derivative of an integral function. Let $f(x) =
\int\limits_1^{x^2} tan(t^3)dt$, and we now want to compute df/dx.
Of course, this can be done

Occasionally we need to define piecewise functions, e.g.

\begin{eqnarray}
f(x) &=&  0, x < 0 \\ 
     &=&  x, 0 <= x < 1\\ 
     &=&  2 - x, 1 < x <= 2\\ 
     &=&  0, x > 2 
\end{eqnarray} 

Today we examine a few ways to define a function like this. A simple way is to use conditional statements.

This works, but the function is not vectorized, i.e. f([-1 0 2 3]) does not evaluate properly (it should give a list or array). You can get vectorized behavior by using list comprehension, or by writing your own loop. This does not fix all limitations, for example you cannot use the f1 function in the quad function to integrate it.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

Neither of those methods is convenient. It would be nicer if the function was vectorized, which would allow the direct notation f1([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]). A simple way to achieve this is through the use of logical arrays. We create logical arrays from comparison statements.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

    x = np.asarray(x)
    y = np.zeros(x.shape)

    y += ((x >= 1) & (x < 2)) * (2 - x)
    return y

print f2([-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
x = np.linspace(-1,3);

A third approach is to use Heaviside functions. The Heaviside function is defined to be zero for x less than some value, and 0.5 for x=0, and 1 for x >= 0. If you can live with y=0.5 for x=0, you can define a vectorized function in terms of Heaviside functions like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

        y = np.zeros(x.shape)

        y[x == 0.0] = 0.5
    else: # special case for 0d array (a number)
        if x > 0: y = 1
        elif x == 0: y = 0.5

In [[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/10/27/compute-pipe-diameter/][Post 1280]] we used a correlation for the Fanning friction factor for turbulent flow in a pipe. For laminar flow (Re < 3000), there is another correlation that is commonly used: $f_F = 16/Re$. Unfortunately, the correlations for laminar flow and turbulent flow have different values at the transition that should occur at Re = 3000. This discontinuity can cause a lot of problems for numerical solvers that rely on derivatives.

Today we examine a strategy for smoothly joining these two functions. First we define the two functions.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def fF_laminar(Re):
    return 16.0 / Re

def fF_turbulent_unvectorized(Re):
    # Nikuradse correlation for turbulent flow
    # 1/np.sqrt(f) = (4.0*np.log10(Re*np.sqrt(f))-0.4)
    # we have to solve this equation to get f
    def func(f):
        return 1/np.sqrt(f) - (4.0*np.log10(Re*np.sqrt(f))-0.4)
    fguess = 0.01
    f, = fsolve(func, fguess)
    return f

# this enables us to pass vectors to the function and get vectors as
# solutions
fF_turbulent = np.vectorize(fF_turbulent_unvectorized)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Now we plot the correlations.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
Re1 = np.linspace(500, 3000)

You can see the discontinuity at Re = 3000. What we need is a method to join these two functions smoothly. We can do that with a sigmoid function.
Sigmoid functions

A sigmoid function smoothly varies from 0 to 1 according to the equation: $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(x-x0)/\alpha}}$. The transition is centered on $x0$, and $\alpha$ determines the width of the transition.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

[[./images/smooth-transitions-sigma.png]]

If we have two functions, $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$ we want to smoothly join, we do it like this: $f(x) = (1-\sigma(x))f_1(x) + \sigma(x)f_2(x)$. There is no formal justification for this form of joining, it is simply a mathematical convenience to get a numerically smooth function. Other functions besides the sigmoid function could also be used, as long as they smoothly transition from 0 to 1, or from 1 to zero.

You can see that away from the transition the combined function is practically equivalent to the original two functions. That is because away from the transition the sigmoid function is 0 or 1. Near Re = 3000 is a smooth transition from one curve to the other curve.

[[http://www.chem.mtu.edu/~fmorriso/DataCorrelationForSmoothPipes2010.pdf][Morrison]] derived a single function for the friction factor correlation over all Re: $f = \frac{0.0076\left(\frac{3170}{Re}\right)^{0.165}}{1 + \left(\frac{3171}{Re}\right)^{7.0}} + \frac{16}{Re}$. Here we show the comparison with the approach used above. The friction factor differs slightly at high Re, becauase Morrison’s is based on the Prandlt correlation, while the work here is based on the Nikuradse correlation. They are similar, but not the same.

*** Summary

The approach demonstrated here allows one to smoothly join two discontinuous functions that describe physics in different regimes, and that must transition over some range of data. It should be emphasized that the method has no physical basis, it simply allows one to create a mathematically smooth function, which could be necessary for some optimizers or solvers to work.
** Smooth transitions between two constants
Suppose we have a parameter that has two different values depending on the value of a dimensionless number. For example when the dimensionless number is much less than 1, x = 2/3, and when x is much greater than 1, x = 1. We desire a smooth transition from 2/3 to 1  as a function of x to avoid discontinuities in functions of x. We will adapt the smooth transitions between functions to be a smooth transition between constants.

We define our function as $x(D) = x0 + (x1 - x0)*(1 - sigma(D,w)$. We control the rate of the transition by the variable $w$

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x0 = 2.0 / 3.0
x1 = 1.5

w = 0.05

D = np.linspace(0,2, 500)

sigmaD = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-(1 - D) / w))

x =  x0 + (x1 - x0)*(1 - sigmaD)

plt.plot(D, x)
plt.xlabel('D'); plt.ylabel('x')
plt.savefig('images/smooth-transitions-constants.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

This is a nice trick to get an analytical function with continuous derivatives for a transition between two constants. You could have the transition occur at a value other than D = 1, as well by changing the argument to the exponential function.

[[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/09/12/on-the-quad-or-trapzd-in-cheme-heaven/][Matlab post]]

What is the difference between quad and trapz? The short answer is that quad integrates functions (via a function handle) using numerical quadrature, and trapz performs integration of arrays of data using the trapezoid method.

Let us look at some examples. We consider the example of computing $\int_0^2 x^3 dx$. the analytical integral is $1/4 x^4$, so we know the integral evaluates to 16/4 = 4. This will be our benchmark for comparison to the numerical methods.

We use the scipy.integrate.quad command  to evaluate this $\int_0^2 x^3 dx$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import quad

ans, err = quad(lambda x: x**3, 0, 2)
print ans
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 4.0

you can also define a function for the integrand.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import quad

def integrand(x):
    return x**3

ans, err = quad(integrand, 0, 2)
print ans
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 4.0

*** Numerical data integration

if we had numerical data like this, we use trapz to integrate it

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
y = x**3

i2 = np.trapz(y, x)

error = (i2 - 4)/4

print i2, error
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 4.25 0.0625

Note the integral of these vectors is greater than 4! You can see why here.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.array([0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
y = x**3

x2 = np.linspace(0, 2)
y2 = x2**3

plt.plot(x, y, label='5 points')
plt.plot(x2, y2, label='50 points')
plt.legend()
plt.savefig('images/quad-1.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

[[./images/quad-1.png]]

The trapezoid method is overestimating the area significantly. With more points, we get much closer to the analytical value.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

x2 = np.linspace(0, 2, 100)
y2 = x2**3

print np.trapz(y2, x2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

*** Combining numerical data with quad

You might want to combine numerical data with the quad function if you want to perform integrals easily. Let us say you are given this data:

x = [0 0.5 1 1.5 2];
y = [0    0.1250    1.0000    3.3750    8.0000];

and you want to integrate this from x = 0.25 to 1.75. We do not have data in those regions, so some interpolation is going to be needed. Here is one approach.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d
from scipy.integrate import quad
import numpy as np

x = [0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]
y = [0,    0.1250,    1.0000,    3.3750,    8.0000]

f = interp1d(x, y)

# numerical trapezoid method
xfine = np.linspace(0.25, 1.75)
yfine = f(xfine)
print np.trapz(yfine, xfine)

# quadrature with interpolation
ans, err = quad(f, 0.25, 1.75)
print ans
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.53199187838
: 2.53125

These approaches are very similar, and both rely on linear interpolation. The second approach is simpler, and uses fewer lines of code.

*** Summary

trapz and quad are functions for getting integrals. Both can be used with numerical data if interpolation is used. The syntax for the quad and trapz function is different in scipy than in Matlab.

Finally, see this [[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/08/30/solving-integral-equations/][post]] for an example of solving an integral equation using quad and fsolve.

The roots of this equation tell you the volume of the gas at those conditions.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

b = 1.45
p = 679.7   # pressure in psi

Note that only one root is real (and even then, we have to interpet 0.j as not being imaginary. Also, in a cubic polynomial, there can only be two imaginary roots). In this case that means there is only one phase present.

Polynomials in numpy are even better than in Matlab, because you get a polynomial object that acts just like a function. Otherwise, they are functionally equivalent.

$$\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx \frac{1}{2}\displaystyle\sum\limits_{k=1}^N(x_{k+1}-x_k)(f(x_{k+1}) + f(x_k))$$

Let us compute the integral of sin(x) from x=0 to $\pi$. To approximate the integral, we need to divide the interval from $a$ to $b$ into $N$ intervals. The analytical answer is 2.0.

We will use this example to illustrate the difference in performance between loops and vectorized operations in python.

for k in range(len(x) - 1):
    f += 0.5 * ((x[k+1] - x[k]) * (y[k+1] + y[k]))

In the last example, there may be loop buried in the sum command. Let us do one final method, using linear algebra, in a single line. The key to understanding this is to recognize the sum is just the result of a dot product of the x differences and y sums. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
t0 = time.time()
f = 0.5 * np.dot(Xk, Yk)
tf = time.time() - t0

The loop method is straightforward to code, and looks alot like the formula that defines the trapezoid method. the vectorized methods are not as easy to read, and take fewer lines of code to write. However, the vectorized methods are much faster than the loop, so the loss of readability could be worth it for very large problems.

The times here are considerably slower than in Matlab. I am not sure if that is a totally fair comparison. Here I am running python through emacs, which may result in slower performance. I also used a very crude way of timing the performance which lumps some system performance in too.

*Problem statement*

find the integral of a function f(x) from a to b i.e.

$$\int_a^b f(x) dx$$

In python we use numerical quadrature to achieve this with the scipy.integrate.quad command.

$$y=x^2$$

from x=0 to x=1. You should be able to work out that the answer is 1/3.

Integrate $f(x,y)=y sin(x)+x cos(y)$ over

$\pi <= x <= 2\pi$

i.e.

$\int_{x=\pi}^{2\pi}\int_{y=0}^{\pi}y sin(x)+x cos(y)dydx$

The syntax in dblquad is a bit more complicated than in Matlab. We have to provide callable functions for the range of the y-variable. Here they are constants, so we create lambda functions that return the constants. Also, note that the order of arguments in the integrand is different than in Matlab.

    'y must be the first argument, and x the second.'
    return y * np.sin(x) + x * np.cos(y)

                   lambda x: np.pi)

*** Summary
scipy.integrate offers the same basic functionality as Matlab does. The syntax differs significantly for these simple examples, but the use of functions for the limits enables freedom to integrate over non-constant limits.

A common need in engineering calculations is to integrate an equation over some range to determine the total change. For example, say we know the volumetric flow changes with time according to $d\nu/dt = \alpha t$, where $\alpha = 1$ L/min and we want to know how much liquid flows into a tank over 10 minutes if the volumetric flowrate is $\nu_0 = 5$ L/min at $t=0$. The answer to that question is the value of this integral: $V = \int_0^{10} \nu_0 + \alpha t dt$. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import scipy
from scipy.integrate import quad

nu0 = 5     # L/min
alpha = 1.0 # L/min
def integrand(t):
    return nu0 + alpha * t

t0 = 0.0
tfinal = 10.0
V, estimated_error = quad(integrand, t0, tfinal)
print('{0:1.2f} L flowed into the tank over 10 minutes'.format(V))

** Sums, products and linear algebra notation - avoiding loops where possible

[[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2012/01/03/sums-products-and-linear-algebra-notation-avoiding-loops-where-possible/][Matlab comparison]]

Today we examine some methods of linear algebra that allow us to
avoid writing explicit loops in Matlab for some kinds of
mathematical operations. 


Consider the operation on two vectors $\bf{a}$
and $\bf{b}$.


 $$y=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n a_ib_i$$

a = [1 2 3 4 5];
b = [3 6 8 9 10];

*** Old-fashioned way with a loop
We can compute this with a loop, where you initialize y, and then
 add the product of the ith elements of a and b to y in each
iteration of the loop. This is known to be slow for large vectors

#+BEGIN_SRC python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [3, 6, 8, 9, 10]

sum = 0
for i in range(len(a)):
    sum = sum + a[i] * b[i]
print sum
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 125

This is an old fashioned style of coding. A more modern, pythonic approach is:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [3, 6, 8, 9, 10]

sum = 0
for x,y in zip(a,b):
    sum += x * y
print sum
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 125

*** The numpy approach
The most compact method is to use the  methods in numpy.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
b = np.array([3, 6, 8, 9, 10])

print np.sum(a * b)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 125

*** Matrix algebra approach.
The operation defined above is actually a dot product. We an directly compute the dot product in numpy. Note that with 1d arrays, python knows what to do and does not require any transpose operations.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
b = np.array([3, 6, 8, 9, 10])

print np.dot(a, b)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 125

*** Another example
Consider $y = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i x_i^2$. This operation is like a weighted sum of squares.
The old-fashioned way to do this is with a loop.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
w = [0.1, 0.25, 0.12, 0.45, 0.98];
x = [9, 7, 11, 12, 8];
y = 0
for wi, xi in zip(w,x):
   y += wi * xi**2
print y
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 162.39

Compare this to the more modern numpy approach.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
w = np.array([0.1, 0.25, 0.12, 0.45, 0.98])
x = np.array([9, 7, 11, 12, 8])
y = np.sum(w * x**2)
print y
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 162.39

We can also express this in matrix algebra form. The operation is equivalent to $y = \vec{x} \cdot D_w \cdot \vec{x}^T$ where $D_w$ is a diagonal matrix with the weights on the diagonal.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
w = np.array([0.1, 0.25, 0.12, 0.45, 0.98])
x = np.array([9, 7, 11, 12, 8])
y = np.dot(x, np.dot(np.diag(w), x))
print y
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 162.39

This last form avoids explicit loops and sums, and relies on fast linear algebra routines.

*** Last example
Consider the sum of the product of three vectors. Let $y = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i x_i y_i$. This is like a weighted sum of products. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

w = np.array([0.1, 0.25, 0.12, 0.45, 0.98])
x = np.array([9, 7, 11, 12, 8])
y = np.array([2, 5, 3, 8, 0])

print np.sum(w * x * y)
print np.dot(w, np.dot(np.diag(x), y))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 57.71
: 57.71


*** Summary
We showed examples of the following equalities between traditional
sum notations and linear algebra


 $$\bf{a}\bf{b}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n a_ib_i$$

 $$\bf{x}\bf{D_w}\bf{x^T}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_ix_i^2$$


 $$\bf{x}\bf{D_w}\bf{y^T}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i x_i y_i$$

These relationships enable one to write the sums as a single line of
python code, which utilizes fast linear algebra subroutines, avoids
the construction of slow loops, and reduces the opportunity for
errors in the code. Admittedly, it introduces the opportunity for
new types of errors, like using the wrong relationship, or linear
algebra errors due to matrix size mismatches.

Here are the four rules for matrix multiplication and transposition

1. $(\mathbf{A}^T)^T = \mathbf{A}$

2. $(\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B})^T = \mathbf{A}^T+\mathbf{B}^T$

3. $(\mathit{c}\mathbf{A})^T = \mathit{c}\mathbf{A}^T$

4. $(\mathbf{AB})^T = \mathbf{B}^T\mathbf{A}^T$

There are two ways to get the transpose of a matrix: with a notation, and
with a function.

** Solving linear equations
Given these equations, find [x1, x2, x3]
\begin{eqnarray}
x_1 - x_2 + x_3 &=& 0 \\
10 x_2 + 25 x_3 &=& 90 \\
20 x_1 + 10 x_2 &=& 80
\end{eqnarray}

When solving linear equations, we can represent them in matrix form. The we simply use =numpy.linalg.solve= to get the solution.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[1, -1, 1],
              [0, 10, 25],
              [20, 10, 0]])

b = np.array([0, 90, 80])

x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
print x
print np.dot(A,x)

# Let us confirm the solution.
# this shows one element is not equal because of float tolerance
print np.dot(A,x) == b

# here we use a tolerance comparison to show the differences is less
# than a defined tolerance.
TOLERANCE = 1e-12
print np.abs((np.dot(A, x) - b)) <= TOLERANCE
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [ 2.  4.  2.]
: [  2.66453526e-15   9.00000000e+01   8.00000000e+01]
: [False  True  True]
: [ True  True  True]

It can be useful to confirm there should be a solution, e.g. that the equations are all independent. The matrix rank will tell us that. Note that numpy:rank does not give you the matrix rank, but rather the number of dimensions of the array. We compute the rank by computing the number of singular values of the matrix that are greater than zero, within a prescribed tolerance. We use the =numpy.linalg.svd= function for that. In Matlab you would use the rref command to see if there are any rows that are all zero, but this command does not exist in numpy. That command does not have practical use in numerical linear algebra and has not been implemented.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[1, -1, 1],
              [0, 10, 25],
              [20, 10, 0]])

b = np.array([0, 90, 80])

# determine number of independent rows in A we get the singular values
# and count the number greater than 0.
TOLERANCE = 1e-12
u, s, v = np.linalg.svd(A)
print 'Singular values: {0}'.format(s)
print '# of independent rows: {0}'.format(np.sum(np.abs(s) > TOLERANCE))

# to illustrate a case where there are only 2 independent rows
# consider this case where row3 = 2*row2.
A = np.array([[1, -1, 1],
              [0, 10, 25],
              [0, 20, 50]])

Occasionally we have integral equations we need to solve in engineering problems, for example, the volume of plug flow reactor can be defined by this equation: $V = \int_{Fa(V=0)}^{Fa} \frac{1}{r_a} dFa$ where $r_a$ is the rate law. Suppose we know the reactor volume is 100 L, the inlet molar flow of A is 1 mol/L, the volumetric flow is 10 L/min, and $r_a = -k Ca$, with $k=0.23$ 1/min. What is the exit molar flow rate? We need to solve the following equation:

$$100 = \int_{Fa(V=0)}^{Fa} \frac{1}{-k Fa/\nu} dFa$$

We start by creating a function handle that describes the integrand. We can use this function in the quad command to evaluate the integral.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import quad
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

k = 0.23
nu = 10.0
Fao = 1.0

def integrand(Fa):
    return -1.0 / (k * Fa / nu)

def func(Fa):
    integral,err = quad(integrand, Fao, Fa)
    return 100.0 - integral

vfunc = np.vectorize(func)
#+END_SRC


#+RESULTS:

We will need an initial guess, so we make a plot of our function to get an idea.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

f = np.linspace(0.01, 1)
plt.plot(f, vfunc(f))
plt.xlabel('Molar flow rate')

Now we can see a zero is near Fa = 0.1, so we proceed to solve the equation.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
Fa_guess = 0.1
Fa_exit, = fsolve(vfunc, Fa_guess)
print 'The exit concentration is {0:1.2f} mol/L'.format(Fa_exit / nu)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 
: >>> The exit concentration is 0.01 mol/L

*** Summary notes
This example seemed a little easier in Matlab, where the quad function seemed to get automatically vectorized. Here we had to do it by hand.

We seek the solution to the following nonlinear equations:

$2 + x + y - x^2 + 8 x y + y^3 = 0$

$1 + 2x - 3y + x^2 + xy - y e^x = 0$

In principle this is easy, we simply need some initial guesses and a nonlinear solver. The challenge here is what would you guess? There could be many solutions. The equations are implicit, so it is not easy to graph them, but let us give it a shot, starting on the x range -5 to 5. The idea is set a value for x, and then solve for y in each equation.

We explore a method that bypasses this problem today. The principle is to introduce a new variable, $\lambda$, which will vary from 0 to 1. at $\lambda=0$ we will have a simpler equation, preferrably a linear one, which can be easily solved, or which can be analytically solved. At $\lambda=1$, we have the original equations. Then, we create a system of differential equations that start at the easy solution, and integrate from $\lambda=0$ to $\lambda=1$, to recover the final solution.

We rewrite the equations as:

$f(x,y) = (2 + x + y) + \lambda(- x^2 + 8 x y + y^3) = 0$

$g(x,y) = (1 + 2x - 3y) + \lambda(x^2 + xy - y e^x) = 0$

Now, at $\lambda=0$ we have the simple linear equations:

$x + y = -2$

$2x - 3y = -1$

These equations are trivial to solve:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
x0 = np.linalg.solve([[1., 1.], [2., -3.]],[ -2, -1])
print x0
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 
: [-1.4 -0.6]

We form the system of ODEs by differentiating the new equations with respect to $\lambda$. Why do we do that? The solution, (x,y) will be a function of $\lambda$. From calculus, you can show that:

$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda}=-\frac{\partial f}{\partial \lambda}$

$\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda}+\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda}=-\frac{\partial g}{\partial \lambda}$

Now, solve this for $\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda}$ and $\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda}$. You can use Cramer’s rule to solve for these to yield:

\begin{eqnarray} \
\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda} &=& \frac{\partial f/\partial y \partial g/\partial \lambda - \partial f/\partial \lambda \partial g/\partial y}{\partial f/\partial x \partial g/\partial y - \partial f/\partial y \partial g/\partial x } \\\\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda} &=& \frac{\partial f/\partial \lambda \partial g/\partial x - \partial f/\partial x \partial g/\partial \lambda}{\partial f/\partial x \partial g/\partial y - \partial f/\partial y \partial g/\partial x } \end{eqnarray} 

For this set of equations: 

\begin{eqnarray} \
\partial f/\partial x &=& 1 - 2\lambda x + 8\lambda y \\\\ 
\partial f/\partial y &=& 1 + 8 \lambda x + 3 \lambda y^2 \\\\
\partial g/\partial x &=& 2 + 2 \lambda x + \lambda y - \lambda y e^x\\\\ 
\partial g/\partial y &=& -3 + \lambda x - \lambda e^x 
\end{eqnarray} 

Now, we simply set up those two differential equations on $\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda}$ and $\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda}$, with the initial conditions at $\lambda = 0$ which is the solution of the simpler linear equations, and integrate to $\lambda = 1$, which is the final solution of the original equations!

You can see the solution is somewhat approximate; the true solution is x = -1, y = 0. The approximation could be improved by lowering the tolerance on the ODE solver. The functions evaluate to a small number, close to zero. You have to apply some judgment to determine if that is sufficiently accurate. For instance if the units on that answer are kilometers, but you need an answer accurate to a millimeter, this may not be accurate enough.

This is a fair amount of work to get a solution! The idea is to solve a simple problem, and then gradually turn on the hard part by the lambda parameter. What happens if there are multiple solutions? The answer you finally get will depend on your $\lambda=0$  starting point, so it is possible to miss solutions this way. For problems with lots of variables, this would be a good approach if you can identify the easy problem.

Integrate this ordinary differential equation (ode):

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = y(t)$$

over the time span of 0 to 2. The initial condition is y(0) = 1.

to solve this equation, you need to create a function of the form: dydt = f(y, t) and then use one of the odesolvers, e.g. odeint.

Adapted from http://archives.math.utk.edu/ICTCM/VOL18/S046/paper.pdf

A mixing tank initially contains 300 g of salt mixed into 1000 L of water. At t=0 min, a solution of 4 g/L salt enters the tank at 6 L/min. At t=10 min, the solution is changed to 2 g/L salt, still entering at 6 L/min. The tank is well stirred, and the tank solution leaves at a rate of 6 L/min. Plot the concentration of salt (g/L) in the tank as a function of time.

A mass balance on the salt in the tank leads to this differential equation: $\frac{dM_S}{dt} = \nu C_{S,in}(t) - \nu M_S/V$ with the initial condition that $M_S(t=0)=300$. The wrinkle is that the inlet conditions are not constant.

$$C_{S,in}(t) = \begin{array}{ll} 0 & t \le 0, \\ 4 & 0 < t \le 10, \\ 2 & t > 10. \end{array}$$

*** Simulating the events feature of Matlab's ode solvers
The ode solvers in Matlab allow you create functions that define events that can stop the integration, detect roots, etc... We will explore how to get a similar effect in python. Here is an example that somewhat does this, but it is only an approximation. We will manually integrate the ODE, adjusting the time step in each iteration to zero in on the solution. When the desired accuracy is reached, we stop the integration. 

It does not appear that events are supported in scipy. A solution is at http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/scipy-dev/2005-July/003078.html, but it does not appear integrated into scipy yet (8 years later ;).

This particular solution works for this example, probably because it is well behaved. It is "downhill" to the desired solution. It is not obvious this would work for every example, and it is certainly possible the algorithm could go "backward" in time. A better approach might be to integrate forward until you detect a sign change in your event function, and then refine it in a separate loop.

I like the events integration in Matlab better, but this is actually pretty functional. It should not be too hard to use this for root counting, e.g. by counting sign changes. It would be considerably harder to get the actual roots. It might also be hard to get the positions of events that include the sign or value of the derivatives at the event points.

ODE solving in Matlab is considerably more advanced in functionality than in scipy. There do seem to be some extra packages, e.g. pydstools, scikits.odes that add extra ode functionality.

Sometimes we have an ODE that depends on a parameter, and we want to solve the ODE for several parameter values. It is inconvenient to write an ode function for each parameter case. Here we examine a convenient way to solve this problem; we pass the parameter to the ODE at runtime. We consider the following ODE:

$$\frac{dCa}{dt} = -k Ca(t)$$

where $k$ is a parameter, and we want to solve the equation for a couple of values of $k$ to test the sensitivity of the solution on the parameter. Our question is, given $Ca(t=0)=2$, how long does it take to get $Ca = 1$, and how sensitive is the answer to small variations in $k$?

You can see there are some variations in the concentration at t = 0.5. You could over or underestimate the concentration if you have the wrong estimate of $k$! You have to use some judgement here to decide how long to run the reaction to ensure a target goal is met.

The odesolvers in scipy can only solve first order ODEs, or systems of first order ODES. To solve a second order ODE, we must convert it by changes of variables to a system of first order ODES. We consider the Van der Pol oscillator here:

$$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - \mu(1-x^2)\frac{dx}{dt} + x = 0$$

$\mu$ is a constant. If we let $y=x - x^3/3$ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator, then we arrive at this set of equations:

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = \mu(x-1/3x^3-y)$$

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = \mu/x$$

Bessel's equation $x^2 y'' + x y' + (x^2 - \nu^2)y=0$ comes up often in engineering problems such as heat transfer. The solutions to this equation are the Bessel functions. To solve this equation numerically, we must convert it to a system of first order ODEs. This can be done by letting $z = y'$ and $z' = y''$ and performing the change of variables:

$$ y' = z$$

$$ z' = \frac{1}{x^2}(-x z - (x^2 - \nu^2) y$$

if we take the case where $\nu = 0$, the solution is known to be the Bessel function $J_0(x)$, which is represented in Matlab as besselj(0,x). The initial conditions for this problem are: $y(0) = 1$ and $y'(0)=0$.

There is a problem with our system of ODEs at x=0. Because of the $1/x^2$ term, the ODEs are not defined at x=0. If we start very close to zero instead, we avoid the problem.

An undamped pendulum with no driving force is described by

$$ y'' + sin(y) = 0$$

We reduce this to standard matlab form of a system of first order ODEs by letting $y_1 = y$ and $y_2=y_1'$. This leads to:

$y_1' = y_2$

$y_2' = -sin(y_1)$

The phase portrait is a plot of a vector field which qualitatively shows how the solutions to these equations will go from a given starting point. here is our definition of the differential equations:

To generate the phase portrait, we need to compute the derivatives $y_1'$ and $y_2'$ at $t=0$ on a grid over the range of values for $y_1$ and $y_2$ we are interested in. We will plot the derivatives as a vector at each (y1, y2) which will show us the initial direction from each point. We will examine the solutions over the range -2 < y1 < 8, and -2 < y2 < 2 for y2, and create a grid of 20×20 points.

What do these figures mean? For starting points near the origin, and small velocities, the pendulum goes into a stable limit cycle. For others, the trajectory appears to fly off into y1 space. Recall that y1 is an angle that has values from $-\pi$ to $\pi$. The y1 data in this case is not wrapped around to be in this range.

One approach to solving BVPs is to use the shooting method. The reason we cannot use an initial value solver for a BVP is that there is not enough information at the initial value to start. In the shooting method, we take the function value at the initial point, and guess what the function derivatives are so that we can do an integration. If our guess was good, then the solution will go through the known second boundary point. If not, we guess again, until we get the answer we need. In this example we repeat the pressure driven flow example, but illustrate the shooting method.

In the pressure driven flow of a fluid with viscosity $\mu$ between two stationary plates separated by distance $d$ and driven by a pressure drop $\Delta P/\Delta x$, the governing equations on the velocity $u$ of the fluid are (assuming flow in the x-direction with the velocity varying only in the y-direction):

$$\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta x} = \mu \frac{d^2u}{dy^2}$$

with boundary conditions $u(y=0) = 0$ and $u(y=d) = 0$, i.e. the no-slip condition at the edges of the plate.

we convert this second order BVP to a system of ODEs by letting $u_1 = u$, $u_2 = u_1'$ and then $u_2' = u_1''$. This leads to:

$\frac{d u_1}{dy} = u_2$

$\frac{d u_2}{dy} = \frac{1}{\mu}\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta x}$

with boundary conditions $u_1(y=0) = 0$ and $u_1(y=d) = 0$.

for this problem we let the plate separation be d=0.1, the viscosity $\mu = 1$, and $\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta x} = -100$.

**** First guess

We need u_1(0) and u_2(0), but we only have u_1(0). We need to guess a value for u_2(0) and see if the solution goes through the u_2(d)=0 boundary value.

Adapted from http://www.physics.arizona.edu/~restrepo/475B/Notes/sourcehtml/node24.html

We want to solve a linear boundary value problem of the form: y” = p(x)y’ + q(x)y + r(x) with boundary conditions y(x1) = alpha and y(x2) = beta.

For this example, we solve the plane poiseuille flow problem using a finite difference approach. An advantage of the approach we use here is we do not have to rewrite the second order ODE as a set of coupled first order ODEs, nor do we have to provide guesses for the solution. We do, however, have to discretize the derivatives and formulate a linear algebra problem.

we want to solve u” = 1/mu*DPDX with u(0)=0 and u(0.1)=0. for this problem we let the plate separation be d=0.1, the viscosity $\mu = 1$, and $\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta x} = -100$.

The idea behind the finite difference method is to approximate the derivatives by finite differences on a grid. See here for details. By discretizing the ODE, we arrive at a set of linear algebra equations of the form $A y = b$, where $A$ and $b$ are defined as follows.

\[A = \left [ \begin{array}{ccccc} %
 2 + h^2 q_1         & -1 + \frac{h}{2} p_1 & 0                    & 0 & 0 \\

Interesting, we have to specify the divisor in numpy.std by the ddof argument. The default for this in Matlab is 1, the default for this function is 0.

Here is the principle of computing a confidence interval.

1.     compute the average
2.    Compute the standard deviation of your data
3.     Define the confidence interval, e.g. 95% = 0.95
4.    compute the student-t multiplier. This is a function of the
      confidence interval you specify, and the number of data points
      you have minus 1. You subtract 1 because one degree of freedom
      is lost from calculating the average.

The confidence interval is defined as ybar +- T_multiplier*std/sqrt(n).

Class A had 30 students who received an average test score of 78, with standard deviation of 10. Class B had 25 students an average test score of 85, with a standard deviation of 15. We want to know if the difference in these averages is statistically relevant. Note that we only have estimates of the true average and standard deviation for each class, and there is uncertainty in those estimates. As a result, we are unsure if the averages are really different. It could have just been luck that a few students in class B did better.

The hypothesis:

the true averages are the same. We need to perform a two-sample t-test of the hypothesis that $\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$ (this is often called the null hypothesis). we use a two-tailed test because we do not care if the difference is positive or negative, either way means the averages are not the same.

compute the t-score for our data

The difference between two averages determined from small sample numbers follows the t-distribution. the t-score is the difference between the difference of the means and the hypothesized difference of the means, normalized by the standard error. we compute the absolute value of the t-score to make sure it is positive for convenience later.

tscore = np.abs(((x1 - x2) - 0) / SE)

Interpretation

A way to approach determinining if the difference is significant or not is to ask, does our computed average fall within a confidence range of the hypothesized value (zero)? If it does, then we can attribute the difference to statistical variations at that confidence level. If it does not, we can say that statistical variations do not account for the difference at that confidence level, and hence the averages must be different.

Let us compute the t-value that corresponds to a 95% confidence level for a mean of zero with the degrees of freedom computed earlier. This means that 95% of the t-scores we expect to get will fall within $\pm$ t95.


#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
from scipy.stats.distributions import  t

ci = 0.95;
alpha = 1 - ci;
t95 = t.ppf(1.0 - alpha/2.0, DF)

print t95
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 
: >>> >>> >>> >>> >>> 2.00574599354

since tscore < t95, we conclude that at the 95% confidence level we cannot say these averages are statistically different because our computed t-score falls in the expected range of deviations. Note that our t-score is very close to the 95% limit. Let us consider a smaller confidence interval.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
ci = 0.94
alpha = 1 - ci;
t95 = t.ppf(1.0 - alpha/2.0, DF)

print t95
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 
: >>> >>> >>> 1.92191364181

at the 94% confidence level, however, tscore > t94, which means we can say with 94% confidence that the two averages are different; class B performed better than class A did. Alternatively, there is only about a 6% chance we are wrong about that statement.
another way to get there

An alternative way to get the confidence that the averages are different is to directly compute it from the cumulative t-distribution function. We compute the difference between all the t-values less than tscore and the t-values less than -tscore, which is the fraction of measurements that are between them. You can see here that we are practically 95% sure that the averages are different.

It appears the data is roughly linear, and we know from the ideal gas law that PV = nRT, or P = nR/V*T, which says P should be linearly correlated with V. Note that the temperature data is in degC, not in K, so it is not expected that P=0 at T = 0. We will use linear algebra to compute the line coefficients.

The confidence interval on the intercept is large, but it does not contain zero at the 95% confidence level.

The R^2 value accounts roughly for the fraction of variation in the data that can be described by the model. Hence, a value close to one means nearly all the variations are described by the model, except for random variations.

The fit looks good, and R^2 is near one, but is it a good model? There are a few ways to examine this. We want to make sure that there are no systematic trends in the errors between the fit and the data, and we want to make sure there are not hidden correlations with other variables. The residuals are the error between the fit and the data. The residuals should not show any patterns when plotted against any variables, and they do not in this case.

There may be some correlations in the residuals with the run order. That could indicate an experimental source of error.

We assume all the errors are uncorrelated with each other. We can use a lag plot to assess this, where we plot residual[i] vs residual[i-1], i.e. we look for correlations between adjacent residuals. This plot should look random, with no correlations if the model is good.

You can see that the confidence interval on the constant and T^2 term includes zero. That is a good indication this additional parameter is not significant. You can see also that the R^2 value is not better than the one from a linear fit,  so adding a parameter does not increase the goodness of fit. This is an example of overfitting the data. Since the constant in this model is apparently not significant, let us consider the simplest model with a fixed intercept of zero.

Let us consider a model with intercept = 0, P = alpha*T.

You can see a slight trend of decreasing value of the residuals as the Temperature increases. This may indicate a deficiency in the model with no intercept. For the ideal gas law in degC: $PV = nR(T+273)$ or $P = nR/V*T + 273*nR/V$, so the intercept is expected to be non-zero in this case. Specifically, we expect the intercept to be 273*R*n/V. Since the molar density of a gas is pretty small, the intercept may be close to, but not equal to zero. That is why the fit still looks ok, but is not as good as letting the intercept be a fitting parameter. That is an example of the deficiency in our model.

In the end, it is hard to justify a model more complex than a line in this case.

Propagation of errors is essential to understanding how the uncertainty in a parameter affects computations that use that parameter. The uncertainty propogates by a set of rules into your solution. These rules are not easy to remember, or apply to complicated situations, and are only approximate for equations that are nonlinear in the parameters.

We will use a Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate error propogation. The idea is to generate a distribution of possible parameter values, and to evaluate your equation for each parameter value. Then, we perform statistical analysis on the results to determine the standard error of the results.

We will assume all parameters are defined by a normal distribution with known mean and standard deviation.

You can numerically perform error propogation analysis if you know the underlying distribution of errors on the parameters in your equations. One benefit of the numerical propogation is you do not have to remember the error propogation rules, and you directly look at the distribution in nonlinear cases. Some limitations of this approach include

    1. You have to know the distribution of the errors in the parameters
    2. You have to assume the errors in parameters are uncorrelated.

Random numbers are used in a variety of simulation methods, most notably Monte Carlo simulations. In another later example, we will see how we can use random numbers for error propogation analysis. First, we discuss two types of pseudorandom numbers we can use in python: uniformly distributed and normally distributed numbers.

Say you are the gambling type, and bet your friend $5 the next random number will be greater than 0.49. Let us ask Python to roll the random number generator for us.

: you lose.

The odds of you winning the last bet are slightly stacked in your favor. There is only a 49% chance your friend wins, but a 51% chance that you win. Lets play the game a lot of times times and see how many times you win, and your friend wins. First, lets generate a bunch of numbers and look at the distribution with a histogram.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

What fraction of points lie between plus and minus one standard deviation of the mean?

samples >= mu-sigma will return a vector of ones where the inequality is true, and zeros where it is not. (samples >= mu-sigma) & (samples <= mu+sigma) will return a vector of ones where there is a one in both vectors, and a zero where there is not. In other words, a vector where both inequalities are true. Finally, we can sum the vector to get the number of elements where the two inequalities are true, and finally normalize by the total number of samples to get the fraction of samples that are greater than -sigma and less than sigma.

The idea here is to formulate a set of linear equations that is easy to solve. We  can express the equations in terms of our unknown fitting parameters $p_i$ as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
x1^0*p0 + x1*p1 = y1
x2^0*p0 + x2*p1 = y2
x3^0*p0 + x3*p1 = y3
etc...

Fit a fourth order polynomial to this data and determine the confidence interval for each parameter. Data from example 5-1 in Fogler, Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering.

We want the equation $Ca(t) = b0 + b1*t + b2*t^2 + b3*t^3 + b4*t^4$ fit to the data in the least squares sense. We can write this in a linear algebra form as: T*p = Ca where T is a matrix of columns [1 t t^2 t^3 t^4], and p is a column vector of the fitting parameters. We want to solve for the p vector and estimate the confidence intervals.

A fourth order polynomial fits the data well, with a good R^2 value. All of the parameters appear to be significant, i.e. zero is not included in any of the parameter confidence intervals. This does not mean this is the best model for the data, just that the model fits well.

Fit the model f(x1,x2; a,b) = a*x1 + x2^b to the data given below. This model has two independent variables, and two parameters.

We want to do a nonlinear fit to find a and b that minimize the summed squared errors between the model predictions and the data. With only two variables, we can graph how the summed squared error varies with the parameters, which may help us get initial guesses. Let us assume the parameters lie in a range, here we choose 0 to 5. In other problems you would adjust this as needed.

We often need to estimate parameters from nonlinear regression of data. We should also consider how good the parameters are, and one way to do that is to consider the confidence interval. A confidence interval tells us a range that we are confident the true parameter lies in. 

In this example we use a nonlinear curve-fitting function: scipy.optimize.curve_fit to give us the parameters in a function that we define which best fit the data. The scipy.optimize.curve_fit function also gives us the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix][covariance]] matrix which we can use to estimate the standard error of each parameter. Finally,  we modify the standard error by a student-t value which accounts for the additional uncertainty in our estimates due to the small number of data points we are fitting to. 

We will fit the function $y = a x / (b + x)$ to some data, and compute the 95% confidence intervals on the parameters.

We can do nonlinear fitting by directly minimizing the summed squared error between a model and data. This method lacks some of the features of other methods, notably the simple ability to get the confidence interval. However, this method is flexible and may offer more insight into how the solution depends on the parameters. 
** Reading in delimited text files

sometimes you will get data in a delimited text file format, .e.g. separated by commas or tabs. Matlab can read these in easily. Suppose we have a file containing this data:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

3   4
5   6
4   8
#+END_EXAMPLE

It is easy to read this directly into variables like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC python

print x,y

we can tell interp1d to use a different interpolation scheme such as cubic polynomial splines like this. For nonlinear functions, this may improve the accuracy of the interpolation, as it implicitly includes information about the curvature by fitting a cubic polynomial over neighboring points.

Wow. That is a weird looking fit. Very different from what Matlab [[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/interp_methods_02.png][produces]]. This is a good teaching moment not to rely blindly on interpolation! We will rely on the linear interpolation from here out which behaves predictably.

*** The inverse question

It is easy to interpolate a new value of f given a value of t. What if we want to know the time that f=0.2? We can approach this a few ways.

**** method 1

We setup a function that we can use fsolve on. The function will be equal to zero at the time. The second function will look like 0 = 0.2 - f(t). The answer for 0.2=exp(-t) is t = 1.6094. Since we use interpolation here, we will get an approximate answer. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

def func(t):
    return 0.2 - g(t)

initial_guess = 2
ans, = fsolve(func, initial_guess)
print ans
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 
: >>> ... ... >>> >>> >>> 2.0556428796

**** method 2: switch the interpolation order

We can switch the order of the interpolation to solve this problem. An issue we have to address in this method is that the "x" values must be monotonically /increasing/. It is somewhat subtle to reverse a list in python. I will use the cryptic syntax of [::-1] instead of the list.reverse() function or reversed() function. list.reverse() actually reverses the list "in place", which changes the contents of the variable. That is not what I want. reversed() returns an iterator which is also not what I want. [::-1] is a fancy indexing trick that returns a reversed list.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
g3 = interp1d(f[::-1], t[::-1])

print g3(0.2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 
: >>> 2.0556428796

*** A harder problem

Suppose we want to know at what time is 1/f = 100? Now we have to decide what do we interpolate: f(t) or 1/f(t). Let us look at both ways and decide what is best. The answer to $1/exp(-t) = 100$ is 4.6052

**** interpolate on f(t) then invert the interpolated number

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
def func(t):
    'objective function. we do some error bounds because we cannot interpolate out of the range.'
    if t < 0.5: t=0.5
    if t > 6: t = 6
    return 100 - 1.0 / g(t)   

initial_guess = 4.5
a1, = fsolve(func, initial_guess)
print a1
print 'The %error is {0:%}'.format((a1 - 4.6052)/4.6052)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

ig = interp1d(t, 1.0 / np.array(f))

def ifunc(t):
    if t < 0.5: t=0.5

In this case you get different errors, one overestimates and one underestimates the answer, and by a lot: \pm 20%. Let us look at what is happening.

You can see that the 1/interpolated f(x) underestimates the value, while interpolated (1/f(x)) overestimates the value. This is an example of where you clearly need more data in that range to make good estimates. Neither interpolation method is doing a great job. The trouble in reality is that you often do not know the real function to do this analysis. Here you can say the time is probably between 3.6 and 5.5 where 1/f(t) = 100, but you can not read much more than that into it. If you need a more precise answer, you need better data, or you need to use an approach other than interpolation. For example, you could fit an exponential function to the data and use that to estimate values at other times.

So which is the best to interpolate? I think you should interpolate the quantity that is linear in the problem you want to solve, so in this case I think interpolating 1/f(x) is better. When you use an interpolated function in a nonlinear function, strange, unintuitive things can happen. That is why the blue curve looks odd. Between data points are linear segments in the original interpolation, but when you invert them, you cause the curvature to form.

To find the maximum, we construct the following function: $\Lambda(x,y; \lambda) = f(x,y)+\lambda g(x,y)$ where $g(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0$, which is the constraint function. Since $g(x,y)=0$, we are not really changing the original function, provided that the constraint is met!

Rather than perform the analytical differentiation, here we develop a way to numerically approximate the partial derivatives.

Let us suppose that a merry farmer has 75 roods (4 roods = 1 acre) on which to plant two crops: wheat and corn. To produce these crops, it costs the farmer (for seed, water, fertilizer, etc. ) $120 per rood for the wheat, and $210 per rood for the corn. The farmer has $15,000 available for expenses, but after the harvest the farmer must store the crops while awaiting favorable or good market conditions. The farmer has storage space for 4,000 bushels. Each rood yields an average of 110 bushels of wheat or 30 bushels of corn. If the net profit per bushel of wheat (after all the expenses) is $1.30 and for corn is $2.00, how should the merry farmer plant the 75 roods to maximize profit?

Let $x$ be the number of roods of wheat planted, and $y$ be the number of roods of corn planted. The profit function is: \( P = (110)($1.3)x + (30)($2)y = 143x + 60y \)

There are some constraint inequalities, specified by the limits on expenses, storage and roodage. They are:

\(\$120x + \$210y <= \$15000\) (The total amount spent cannot exceed the amount the farm has)

\(110x + 30y <= 4000\) (The amount generated should not exceed storage space.)

\(x + y <= 75\) (We cannot plant more space than we have.)

\(0 <= x and 0 <= y \) (all amounts of planted land must be positive.)

To solve this problem, we cast it as a linear programming problem, which minimizes a function f(X) subject to some constraints. We create a proxy function for the negative of profit, which we seek to minimize.

f = -(143*x + 60*y)

This is shown by the fact that the dot product of the two vectors is very close to zero. It is not zero because of the accuracy criteria that is used to stop the minimization is not high enough.

Python provides a sum function to compute the sum of a list. However, the sum function does not work on every arrangement of numbers, and it certainly does not work on nested lists. We will solve this problem with recursion.

Here is a simple example.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # a list
print sum(v)

v = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)  # a tuple
print sum(v)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 45
: 45

If you have data in a dictionary, sum works by default on the keys. You can give the sum function the values like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
v = {'a':1, 'b':3, 'c':4}
print sum(v.values())
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 8

*** Nested lists

Suppose now we have nested lists. This kind of structured data might come up if you had grouped several things together. For example, suppose we have 5 departments, with 1, 5, 15, 7 and 17 people in them, and in each department they are divided into groups.

Department 1: 1 person
Department 2: group of 2 and group of 3
Department 3: group of 4 and 11, with a subgroups of 5 and 6 making
              up the group of 11.
Department 4: 7 people
Department 5: one group of 8 and one group of 9.

We might represent the data like this nested list. Now, if we want to compute the total number of people, we need to add up each group. We cannot simply sum the list, because some elements are single numbers, and others are lists, or lists of lists. We need to recurse through each entry until we get down to a number, which we can add to the running sum. 
#+BEGIN_SRC python
v = [1, 
    [2, 3],
    [4, [5, 6]],
    7,
    [8,9]]

def recursive_sum(X):
    'compute sum of arbitrarily nested lists'
    s = 0 # initial value of the sum

    for i in range(len(X)):
        import types  # we use this to test if we got a number
        if isinstance(X[i], (types.IntType,
                             types.LongType,
                             types.FloatType,
                             types.ComplexType)):
            # this is the terminal step
            s += X[i]
        else:
            # we did not get a number, so we recurse
            s += recursive_sum(X[i])
    return s

print recursive_sum(v)
print recursive_sum([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) # test on non-nested list
#+END_SRC

In [[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2012/05/28/lather-rinse-and-repeat/][Post 1970]] we examined recursive functions that could be replaced by loops. Here we examine a function that can only work with recursion because the nature of the nested data structure is arbitrary. There are arbitary branches and depth in the data structure. Recursion is nice because you do not have to define that structure in advance.

Recursive functions are functions that call themselves repeatedly until some exit condition is met. Today we look at a classic example of recursive function for computing a factorial. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is denoted n!, and is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

The key ideas in defining a recursive function is that there needs to be some logic to identify when to terminate the function. Then, you need logic that calls the function again, but with a smaller part of the problem. Here we recursively call the function with n-1 until it gets called with n=0. 0! is defined to be 1.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

def recursive_factorial(n):
    '''compute the factorial recursively. Note if you put a negative
    number in, this function will never end. We also do not check if
    n is an integer.'''
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * recursive_factorial(n - 1)

print recursive_factorial(5)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 120

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.misc import factorial
print factorial(5)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 120.0

**** Compare to a loop solution

This example can also be solved by a loop. This loop is easier to read and understand than the recursive function. Note the recursive nature of defining the variable as itself times a number.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
n = 5
factorial_loop = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial_loop *= i

print factorial_loop
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 120

There are some significant differences in this example than in Matlab. 

  1. the syntax of the for loop is quite different with the use of the =in= operator.
  2. python has the nice *= operator to replace a = a * i
  3. We have to loop from 1 to n+1 because the last number in the range is not returned.

*** Conclusions

Recursive functions have a special niche in mathematical programming. There is often another way to accomplish the same goal. That is not always true though, and in a future post we will examine cases where recursion is the only way to solve a problem.

* Worked examples
** Peak finding in Raman spectroscopy
   :PROPERTIES:
   :categories: data-analysis
   :END:
Raman spectroscopy is a vibrational spectroscopy. The data typically comes as intensity vs. wavenumber, and it is discrete. Sometimes it is necessary to identify the precise location of a peak. In this post, we will use spline smoothing to construct an interpolating function of the data, and then use fminbnd to identify peak positions.

This example was originally worked out in Matlab at http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2012/08/27/peak-finding-in-raman-spectroscopy/

numpy:loadtxt

Let us take a look at the raw data.

The next thing to do is narrow our focus to the region we are interested in between 1340 cm^{-1} and 1360 cm^{-1}.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
ind = (w > 1340) & (w < 1360)
w1 = w[ind]
i1 = i[ind]

plt.plot(w1, i1, 'b. ')

Next we consider a scipy:UnivariateSpline. This function "smooths" the data.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
from scipy.interpolate import UnivariateSpline

# s is a "smoothing" factor
sp = UnivariateSpline(w1, i1, s=3000)

plt.plot(w1, i1, 'b. ')
plt.plot(w1, sp(w1), 'r-')
plt.xlabel('Raman shift (cm$^{-1}$)')
plt.ylabel('Intensity (counts)')

: <matplotlib.text.Text object at 0x1dd3b950>

[[./images/raman-3.png]]

Note that the UnivariateSpline function returns a "callable" function! Our next goal is to find the places where there are peaks. This is defined by the first derivative of the data being equal to zero. It is easy to get the first derivative of a UnivariateSpline with a second argument as shown below.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
# get the first derivative evaluated at all the points
d1 =  sp(w1, 1)
plt.plot(w1, d1, label='first derivative')
plt.xlabel('Raman shift (cm$^{-1}$)')
plt.ylabel('First derivative')

# find the places where the first derivative crosses zero
s = np.zeros(d1.shape)
s[d1 >= 0] = 1
s[d1 < 0] = 0

initial_guesses = w1[np.diff(s) == -1]
plt.plot(initial_guesses, 0*initial_guesses, 'ro ', label='Guesses of zeros')
plt.legend(loc='best')

Now, we can use these initial guesses to solve for the actual values.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session 
from scipy.optimize import fminbound

def func(w):
    'function to minimize'
    return -sp(w)

for value in initial_guesses:
    sol = fminbound(func, value - 1, value + 1)
    plt.plot(sol, sp(sol), 'ro ', ms=8)
    print 'Peak found at {0} cm^{{-1}}'.format(sol)

plt.plot(w1, i1, 'b. ')
plt.plot(w1, sp(w1), 'r-')
plt.xlabel('Raman shift (cm$^{-1}$)')
plt.ylabel('Intensity (counts)')
plt.savefig('images/raman-5.png')

In the end, we have illustrated how to construct a spline smoothing interpolation function and to find maxima in the function, including generating some initial guesses. There is more art to this than you might like, since you have to judge how much smoothing is enough or too much. With too much, you may smooth peaks out. With too little, noise may be mistaken for peaks.

*** Summary notes
Using org-mode with :session allows a large script to be broken up into mini sections. However, it only seems to work with the default python mode in Emacs, and it does not work with emacs-for-python or the latest python-mode. I also do not really like the output style, e.g. the output from the plotting commands.

** Curve fitting to get overlapping peak areas

Today we examine an approach to fitting curves to overlapping peaks to deconvolute them so we can estimate the area under each curve. We have a text file that contains data from a gas chromatograph with two peaks that overlap. We want the area under each peak to estimate the gas composition. You will see how to read the text file in, parse it to get the data for plotting and analysis, and then how to fit it.


A line like "# of Points	9969" tells us the number of points we have to read. The data starts after a line containing "R.Time	Intensity". Here we read the number of points, and then get the data into arrays.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

        npoints = int(line.split()[-1])
    elif 'R.Time	Intensity' in line:
        i += 1
        break

# now get the data
t, intensity = [], []

t = np.array(t)
intensity = np.array(intensity)

# now plot the data in the relevant time frame

The peaks are asymmetric, decaying gaussian functions. We define a function for this 

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
from scipy.special import erf

def asym_peak(t, pars):
    'from Anal. Chem. 1994, 66, 1294-1301'

    a1 = pars[1]  # elution time
    a2 = pars[2]  # width of gaussian
    a3 = pars[3]  # exponential damping term
    f = (a0/2/a3*np.exp(a2**2/2.0/a3**2 + (a1 - t)/a3)
         *(erf((t-a1)/(np.sqrt(2.0)*a2) - a2/np.sqrt(2.0)/a3) + 1.0))
    return f
#+END_SRC

To get two peaks, we simply add two peaks together.

    a10 = pars[0]  # peak area
    a11 = pars[1]  # elution time
    a12 = pars[2]  # width of gaussian
    a13 = pars[3]  # exponential damping term
    a20 = pars[4]  # peak area
    a21 = pars[5]  # elution time
    a22 = pars[6]  # width of gaussian
    a23 = pars[7]  # exponential damping term   
    p1 = asym_peak(t, [a10, a11, a12, a13])
    p2 = asym_peak(t, [a20, a21, a22, a23])
    return p1 + p2
#+END_SRC

To show the function is close to reasonable, we plot the fitting function with an initial guess for each parameter. The fit is not good, but we have only guessed the parameters for now.

The fits are not perfect. The small peak is pretty good, but there is an unphysical tail on the larger peak, and a small mismatch at the peak. There is not much to do about that, it means the model peak we are using is not a good model for the peak. We will still integrate the areas though.

This sample was air, and the first peak is oxygen, and the second peak is nitrogen. we come pretty close to the actual composition of air, although it is low on the oxygen content. To do better, one would have to use a calibration curve.

In the end, the overlap of the peaks is pretty small, but it is still difficult to reliably and reproducibly deconvolute them. By using an algorithm like we have demonstrated here, it is possible at least to make the deconvolution reproducible.

*** Notable differences from Matlab
1. The order of arguments to np.trapz is reversed. 
2. The order of arguments to the fitting function scipy.optimize.curve_fit is different than in Matlab.
3. The scipy.optimize.curve_fit function expects a fitting function that has all parameters as arguments, where Matlab expects a vector of parameters.

[[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/12/20/the-gibbs-free-energy-of-a-reacting-mixture-and-the-equilibrium-composition/][Matlab post]]

In this post we derive the equations needed to find the equilibrium composition of a reacting mixture. We use the method of direct minimization of the Gibbs free energy of the reacting mixture.

The Gibbs free energy of a mixture is defined as $G = \sum\limits_j \mu_j n_j$ where $\mu_j$ is the chemical potential of species $j$, and it is temperature and pressure dependent, and $n_j$ is the number of moles of species $j$.

We define the chemical potential as $\mu_j = G_j^\circ + RT\ln a_j$, where $G_j^\circ$ is the Gibbs energy in a standard state, and $a_j$ is the activity of species $j$ if the pressure and temperature are not at standard state conditions.

If a reaction is occurring, then the number of moles of each species are related to each other through the reaction extent $\epsilon$ and stoichiometric coefficients: $n_j = n_{j0} + \nu_j \epsilon$. Note that the reaction extent has units of moles.

Combining these three equations and expanding the terms leads to:

$$G = \sum\limits_j n_{j0}G_j^\circ +\sum\limits_j \nu_j G_j^\circ \epsilon +RT\sum\limits_j(n_{j0} + \nu_j\epsilon)\ln a_j $$

The first term is simply the initial Gibbs free energy that is present before any reaction begins, and it is a constant. It is difficult to evaluate, so we will move it to the left side of the equation in the next step, because it does not matter what its value is since it is a constant. The second term is related to the Gibbs free energy of reaction: $\Delta_rG = \sum\limits_j \nu_j G_j^\circ$. With these observations we rewrite the equation as:

$$G - \sum\limits_j n_{j0}G_j^\circ = \Delta_rG \epsilon +RT\sum\limits_j(n_{j0} + \nu_j\epsilon)\ln a_j $$

Now, we have an equation that allows us to compute the change in Gibbs free energy as a function of the reaction extent, initial number of moles of each species, and the activities of each species. This difference in Gibbs free energy has no natural scale, and depends on the size of the system, i.e. on $n_{j0}$. It is desirable to avoid this, so we now rescale the equation by the total initial moles present, $n_{T0}$ and define a new variable $\epsilon' = \epsilon/n_{T0}$, which is dimensionless. This leads to:

$$ \frac{G - \sum\limits_j n_{j0}G_j^\circ}{n_{T0}} = \Delta_rG \epsilon' + RT \sum\limits_j(y_{j0} + \nu_j\epsilon')\ln a_j $$

where $y_{j0}$ is the initial mole fraction of species $j$ present. The mole fractions are intensive properties that do not depend on the system size. Finally, we need to address $a_j$. For an ideal gas, we know that $A_j = \frac{y_j P}{P^\circ}$, where the numerator is the partial pressure of species $j$ computed from the mole fraction of species $j$ times the total pressure. To get the mole fraction we note:

$$y_j = \frac{n_j}{n_T} = \frac{n_{j0} + \nu_j \epsilon}{n_{T0} + \epsilon \sum\limits_j \nu_j} = \frac{y_{j0} + \nu_j \epsilon'}{1 + \epsilon'\sum\limits_j \nu_j} $$

This finally leads us to an equation that we can evaluate as a function of reaction extent:

$$ \frac{G - \sum\limits_j n_{j0}G_j^\circ}{n_{T0}} = \widetilde{\widetilde{G}} = \Delta_rG \epsilon' + RT\sum\limits_j(y_{j0} + \nu_j\epsilon') \ln\left(\frac{y_{j0}+\nu_j\epsilon'}{1+\epsilon'\sum\limits_j\nu_j} \frac{P}{P^\circ}\right) $$

we use a double tilde notation to distinguish this quantity from the quantity derived by Rawlings and Ekerdt which is further normalized by a factor of $RT$. This additional scaling makes the quantities dimensionless, and makes the quantity have a magnitude of order unity, but otherwise has no effect on the shape of the graph.

Finally, if we know the initial mole fractions, the initial total pressure, the Gibbs energy of reaction, and the stoichiometric coefficients, we can plot the scaled reacting mixture energy as a function of reaction extent. At equilibrium, this energy will be a minimum. We consider the example in Rawlings and Ekerdt where isobutane (I) reacts with 1-butene (B) to form 2,2,3-trimethylpentane (P). The reaction occurs at a total pressure of 2.5 atm at 400K, with equal molar amounts of I and B. The standard Gibbs free energy of reaction at 400K is -3.72 kcal/mol. Compute the equilibrium composition.

When there are multiple species, you need the smallest $epsilon'_{max}$ to avoid getting negative mole numbers.

** Conservation of mass in chemical reactions
[[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/12/18/conservation-of-mass-in-chemical-reactions/][Matlab post]]

Atoms cannot be destroyed in non-nuclear chemical reactions, hence it follows that the same number of atoms entering a reactor must also leave the reactor. The atoms may leave the reactor in a different molecular configuration due to the reaction, but the total mass leaving the reactor must be the same. Here we look at a few ways to show this.

We consider the water gas shift reaction : $CO + H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_2 + CO_2$. We can illustrate the conservation of mass with the following equation: $\bf{\nu}\bf{M}=\bf{0}$. Where $\bf{\nu}$ is the stoichiometric coefficient vector and $\bf{M}$ is a column vector of molecular weights. For simplicity, we use pure isotope molecular weights, and not the isotope-weighted molecular weights. This equation simply examines the mass on the right side of the equation and the mass on left side of the equation. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
nu = [-1, -1, 1, 1];
M = [28, 18, 2, 44];
print np.dot(nu, M)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0

You can see that sum of the stoichiometric coefficients times molecular weights is zero. In other words a CO and H_2O have the same mass as H_2 and CO_2.

For any balanced chemical equation, there are the same number of each kind of atom on each side of the equation. Since the mass of each atom is unchanged with reaction, that means the mass of all the species that are reactants must equal the mass of all the species that are products! Here we look at the number of C, O, and H on each side of the reaction. Now if we add the mass of atoms in the reactants and products, it should sum to zero (since we used the negative sign for stoichiometric coefficients of reactants).

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import numpy as np
            # C   O   H
reactants = [-1, -2, -2]
products  = [ 1,  2,  2]

atomic_masses = [12.011, 15.999, 1.0079]  # atomic masses

print np.dot(reactants, atomic_masses) + np.dot(products, atomic_masses)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

: >>> ... >>> >>> >>> >>> >>> 0.0

That’s all there is to mass conservation with reactions. Nothing changes if there are lots of reactions, as long as each reaction is properly balanced, and none of them are nuclear reactions!

The [[http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/][NIST webbook]] provides parameterized models of the enthalpy, entropy and heat capacity of many molecules. In this example, we will examine how to use these to compute the equilibrium constant for the water gas shift reaction $CO + H_2O \rightleftharpoons CO_2 + H_2$ in the temperature range of 500K to 1000K.

Parameters are provided for:

   Cp = heat capacity (J/mol*K)
   H = standard enthalpy (kJ/mol)
   S = standard entropy (J/mol*K)

with models in the form: $Cp^\circ = A + B*t + C*t^2 + D*t^3 + E/t^2$

$H^\circ - H^\circ_{298.15}= A*t + B*t^2/2 + C*t^3/3 + D*t^4/4 - E/t + F - H$

$S^\circ = A*ln(t) + B*t + C*t^2/2 + D*t^3/3 - E/(2*t^2) + G$

where $t=T/1000$, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin. We can use this data to calculate equilibrium constants in the following manner. First, we have heats of formation at standard state for each compound; for elements, these are zero by definition, and for non-elements, they have values available from the NIST webbook. There are also values for the absolute entropy at standard state. Then, we have an expression for the change in enthalpy from standard state as defined above, as well as the absolute entropy. From these we can derive the reaction enthalpy, free energy and entropy at standard state, as well as at other temperatures.

We will examine the water gas shift enthalpy, free energy and equilibrium constant from 500K to 1000K, and finally compute the equilibrium composition of a gas feed containing 5 atm of CO and H_2 at 1000K.

*** Non-standard state $\Delta H$ and $\Delta G$

We have to correct for temperature change away from standard state. We only correct the enthalpy for this temperature change. The correction looks like this:

$$ \Delta H_{rxn}(T) = \Delta H_{rxn}(T_{ref}) + \sum_i \nu_i (H_i(T)-H_i(T_{ref}))$$

Where $\nu_i$ are the stoichiometric coefficients of each species, with appropriate sign for reactants and products, and $(H_i(T)-H_i(T_{ref})$ is precisely what is calculated for each species with the equations

The entropy is on an absolute scale, so we directly calculate entropy at each temperature. Recall that H is in kJ/mol and S is in J/mol/K, so we divide S by 1000 to make the units match.

Over this temperature range the reaction is exothermic, although near 1000K it is just barely exothermic. At higher temperatures we expect the reaction to become endothermic.

*** Equilibrium constant calculation

Note the equilibrium constant starts out high, i.e. strongly favoring the formation of products, but drops very quicky with increasing temperature.

*** Equilibrium yield of WGS

Now let us suppose we have a reactor with a feed of H_2O and CO at 10atm at 1000K. What is the equilibrium yield of H_2? Let $\epsilon$ be the extent of reaction, so that $F_i = F_{i,0} + \nu_i \epsilon$. For reactants, $\nu_i$ is negative, and for products, $\nu_i$ is positive. We have to solve for the extent of reaction that satisfies the equilibrium condition.

*** Compute gas phase pressures of each species

Since there is no change in moles for this reaction, we can directly calculation the pressures from the equilibrium conversion and the initial pressure of gases. you can see there is a slightly higher pressure of H_2 and CO_2 than the reactants, consistent with the equilibrium constant of about 1.44 at 1000K. At a lower temperature there would be a much higher yield of the products. For example, at 550K the equilibrium constant is about 58, and the pressure of H_2 is 4.4 atm due to a much higher equilibrium conversion of 0.88.

*** Summary

The NIST Webbook provides a plethora of data for computing thermodynamic properties. It is a little tedious to enter it all into Matlab, and a little tricky to use the data to estimate temperature dependent reaction energies. A limitation of the Webbook is that it does not tell you have the thermodynamic properties change with pressure. Luckily, those changes tend to be small.

I noticed a different behavior in interpolation between scipy.interpolate.interp1d and Matlab's interp1. The scipy function returns an interpolating function, whereas the Matlab function directly interpolates new values, and returns the actual interpolated data.

If reaction rates are fast compared to diffusion in a porous catalyst pellet, then the observed kinetics will appear to be slower than they really are because not all of the catalyst surface area will be effectively used. For example, the reactants may all be consumed in the near surface area of a catalyst bead, and the inside of the bead will be unutilized because no reactants can get in due to the high reaction rates.

A mole balance on the particle volume in spherical coordinates with a first order reaction leads to: $\frac{d^2Ca}{dr^2} + \frac{2}{r}\frac{dCa}{dr}-\frac{k}{D_e}C_A=0$ with boundary conditions $C_A(R) = C_{As}$ and $\frac{dCa}{dr}=0$ at $r=0$. We convert this equation to a system of first order ODEs by letting $W_A=\frac{dCa}{dr}$.

We have a condition of no flux at r=0 and Ca(R) = CAs, which makes this a boundary value problem. We use the shooting method here, and guess what Ca(0) is and iterate the guess to get Ca(R) = CAs.

You can see the concentration of A inside the particle is significantly lower than outside the particle. That is because it is reacting away faster than it can diffuse into the particle. Hence, the overall reaction rate in the particle is lower than it would be without the diffusion limit.

The effectiveness factor is the ratio of the actual reaction rate in the particle with diffusion limitation to the ideal rate in the particle if there was no concentration gradient:

$$\eta = \frac{\int_0^R k'' a C_A(r) 4 \pi r^2 dr}{\int_0^R k'' a C_{As} 4 \pi r^2 dr}$$

We will evaluate this numerically from our solution and compare it to the analytical solution. The results are in good agreement, and you can make the numerical estimate better by increasing the number of points in the solution so that the numerical integration is more accurate.

Why go through the numerical solution when an analytical solution exists? The analytical solution here is only good for 1st order kinetics in a sphere. What would you do for a complicated rate law? You might be able to find some limiting conditions where the analytical equation above is relevant, and if you are lucky, they are appropriate for your problem. If not, it is a good thing you can figure this out numerically!

A heat exchanger must handle 2.5 L/s of water through a smooth pipe with length of 100 m. The pressure drop cannot exceed 103 kPa at 25 degC. Compute the minimum pipe diameter required for this application.

Adapted from problem 8.8 in Problem solving in chemical and Biochemical Engineering with Polymath, Excel, and Matlab. page 303.

We need to estimate the Fanning friction factor for these conditions so we can estimate the frictional losses that result in a pressure drop for a uniform, circular pipe. The frictional forces are given by $F_f = 2f_F \frac{\Delta L v^2}{D}$, and the corresponding pressure drop is given by $\Delta P = \rho F_f$. In these equations, $\rho$ is the fluid density, $v$ is the fluid velocity, $D$ is the pipe diameter, and $f_F$ is the Fanning friction factor. The average fluid velocity is given by $v = \frac{q}{\pi D^2/4}$.

For laminar flow, we estimate $f_F = 16/Re$, which is a linear equation, and for turbulent flow ($Re > 2100$) we have the implicit equation $\frac{1}{\sqrt{f_F}}=4.0 \log(Re \sqrt{f_F})-0.4$. Of course, we define $Re = \frac{D v\rho}{\mu}$ where $\mu$ is the viscosity of the fluid.

It is known that $\rho(T) = 46.048 + 9.418 T -0.0329 T^2 +4.882\times10^{-5}-2.895\times10^{-8}T^4$ and $\mu = \exp\left({-10.547 + \frac{541.69}{T-144.53}}\right)$ where $\rho$ is in kg/m^3 and $\mu$ is in kg/(m*s).

The aim is to find $D$ that solves: $\Delta p = \rho 2 f_F \frac{\Delta L v^2}{D}$. This is a nonlinear equation in $D$, since D affects the fluid velocity, the Re, and the Fanning friction factor. Here is the solution

We will use the data to find the temperature at which the vapor pressure of acetone is 400 mmHg.

We previously learned to read a datafile containing lots of Antoine coefficients into a database, and use the coefficients to estimate vapor pressure of a single compound. Here we use those coefficents to compute a bubble point pressure of a mixture. 

The bubble point is the temperature at which the sum of the component vapor pressures is equal to the the total pressure. This is where a bubble of vapor will first start forming, and the mixture starts to boil.

Consider an equimolar mixture of benzene, toluene, chloroform, acetone and methanol. Compute the bubble point at 760 mmHg, and the gas phase composition. The gas phase composition is given by: $y_i = x_i*P_i/P_T$.

Maxwell proposed to replace this region by a flat line, where the area above and below the curves are equal. Today, we examine how to identify where that line should be.

To find the areas, we need to know where the intersection of the vdW eqn with the horizontal line. This is the same as asking what are the roots of the vdW equation at that Pr. We need all three intersections so we can integrate from the first root to the middle root, and then the middle root to the third root. We take advantage of the polynomial nature of the vdW equation, which allows us to use the roots command to get all the roots at once. The polynomial is $V_R^3 - \frac{1}{3}(1+8 T_R/P_R) + 3/P_R - 1/P_R = 0$. We use the coefficients t0 get the roots like this.

The equilibrium composition of a reaction is the one that minimizes the total Gibbs free energy. The Gibbs free energy of a reacting ideal gas mixture depends on the mole fractions of each species, which are determined by the initial mole fractions of each species, the extent of reactions that convert each species, and the equilibrium constants.

Reaction 1: $I + B \rightleftharpoons P1$

Reaction 2: $I + B \rightleftharpoons P2$

Here we define the Gibbs free energy of the mixture as a function of the reaction extents.

#+END_SRC

The equilibrium constants for these reactions are known, and we seek to find the equilibrium reaction extents so we can determine equilibrium compositions. The equilibrium reaction extents are those that minimize the Gibbs free energy.  We have the following constraints, written in standard less than or equal to form:

$-\epsilon_1 \le 0$

$-\epsilon_2 \le 0$

$\epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2 \le 0.5$

In Matlab we express this in matrix form as Ax=b where $A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{array} \right]$ and $b = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0.5\end{array} \right]$

Unlike in Matlab, in python we construct the inequality constraints as functions that are greater than or equal to zero when the constraint is met.

One way we can verify our solution is to plot the gibbs function and see where the minimum is, and whether there is more than one minimum. We start by making grids over the range of 0 to 0.5. Note we actually start slightly above zero because at zero there are some numerical imaginary elements of the gibbs function or it is numerically not defined since there are logs of zero there. We also set all elements where the sum of the two extents is greater than 0.5 to near zero, since those regions violate the constraints.

That is it. The main difference between this and Matlab is the order of arguments in odeint is different, and the ode function has differently ordered arguments. 

** Finding equilibrium conversion

A common problem to solve in reaction engineering is finding the equilibrium conversion.[fn:1] A typical problem to solve is the following nonlinear equation:

$1.44 = \frac{X_e^2}{(1-X_e)^2}$

To solve this we create a function:

$f(X_e)=0=1.44 - \frac{X_e^2}{(1-X_e)^2}$

and use a nonlinear solver to find the value of $X_e$ that makes this function equal to zero. We have to provide an initial guess. Chemical intuition suggests that the solution must be between 0 and 1, and mathematical intuition suggests the solution might be near 0.5 (which would give a ratio near 1).

Here is our solution.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

def func(Xe):
    z = 1.44 - (Xe**2)/(1-Xe)**2
    return z

X0 = 0.5

print('The equilibrium conversion is X = {0:1.2f}'.format(Xe))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Given a continuously stirred tank reactor with a volume of 66,000 dm^3 where the reaction $A \rightarrow B$ occurs, at a rate of $-r_A = k C_A^2$ ($k=3$ L/mol/h), with an entering molar flow of F_{A0} = 5 mol/h and a volumetric flowrate of 10 L/h, what is the exit concentration of A?

From a mole balance we know that at steady state $0 = F_{A0} - F_A + V r_A$. That equation simply states the sum of the molar flow of A in in minus the molar flow of A out  plus the molar rate A is generated is equal to zero at steady state. This is directly the equation we need to solve. We need the following relationship:

1. $F_A = v0 C_A$

#+BEGIN_SRC python :exports both
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

Fa0 = 5.0
v0 = 10.

V = 66000.0  # reactor volume L^3

def func(Ca):

    ra = -k * Ca**2  # rate of reaction of A L/mol/h

# CA guess that that 90 % is reacted away

It is a little confusing why it is necessary to put a comma after the CA_sol in the fsolve command. If you do not put it there, you get brackets around the answer.

An alternative approach of evaluating an integral is to integrate a differential equation. For the batch reactor, the differential equation that describes conversion as a function of time is:

$\frac{dX}{dt} = -r_A V/N_{A0}$.

Given a value of initial concentration, or volume and initial number of moles of A, we can integrate this ODE to find the conversion at some later time. We assume that $X(t=0)=0$. We will integrate the ODE over a time span of 0 to 10,000 seconds.

The problem we solve here is that we have several compounds containing Ni and Al, and a bulk mixture of a particular composition of Ni and Al. We want to know which mixture of phases will minimize the total energy. The tricky part is that the optimization is constrained because the mixture of phases must have the overall stoichiometry we want.  We formulate the problem like this.

Basically, we want to minimize the function $E = \sum w_i E_i$, where $w_i$ is the mass of phase $i$, and $E_i$ is the energy per unit mass of phase $i$. There are some constraints to ensure conservation of mass. Let us consider the following compounds: Al, NiAl, Ni3Al, and Ni, and consider a case where the bulk composition of our alloy is 93.8% Ni and balance Al. We want to know which phases are present, and in what proportions. There are some subtleties in considering the formula and molecular weight of an alloy. We consider the formula with each species amount normalized so the fractions all add up to one. For example, Ni_3Al is represented as Ni_{0.75}Al_{0.25}, and the molecular weight is computed as 0.75*MW_{Ni} + 0.25*MW_{Al}.

We use scipy.optimize.fmin_slsqp to solve this problem, and define two equality constraint functions, and the bounds on each weight fraction.

Note: the energies in this example were computed by density functional theory at 0K.

: NiAl       -0.00%
: Ni3Al     +50.00%
: Ni        +50.00%

This means we have a 1:1 molar ratio of Ni and Ni_{0.75}Al_{0.25}. That works out to the overall bulk composition in this particular problem.

Let us verify that these two approaches really lead to the same conclusions. On a weight basis we estimate 53.3%wt Ni and 46.7%wt Ni3Al, whereas we predict an equimolar mixture of the two phases. Below we compute the mole fraction of Ni in each case.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
# these are atomic masses of each species
Ni = 58.693
Al = 26.982

# Molar case
# 1 mol Ni + 1 mol Ni_{0.75}Al_{0.25}
N1 = 1.0; N2 = 1.0
mol_Ni = 1.0 * N1 + 0.75 * N2
xNi = mol_Ni / (N1 + N2)
print xNi

# Mass case
M1 = 0.533; M2 = 0.467
MW1 = Ni; MW2 = 0.75*Ni + 0.25*Al

xNi2 = (1.0 * M1/MW1 + 0.75 * M2 / MW2) / (M1/MW1 + M2/MW2)
print xNi2
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.875
: 0.874192746385

You can see the overall mole fraction of Ni is practically the same in each case.

  :END:

I think an essential feature in an engineering computational environment is properly handling units and unit conversions. Mathcad supports that pretty well. I wrote a [[https://github.com/jkitchin/matlab-cmu][package]] for doing it in Matlab. Today I am going to explore units in python. Here are some of the packages that I have found which support units to some extent

1. http://pypi.python.org/pypi/units/
2. http://packages.python.org/quantities/user/tutorial.html
3. http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/ScientificPython/ScientificPythonManual/Scientific.Physics.PhysicalQuantities-module.html
4. http://home.scarlet.be/be052320/Unum.html
5. https://simtk.org/home/python_units
6. http://docs.enthought.com/scimath/units/intro.html

The last one looks most promising.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scimath.units.volume import liter
from scimath.units.substance import mol

q = np.array([1, 2, 3]) * mol
print q

P = q / liter
print P

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1.0*mol 2.0*mol 3.0*mol]
: [1000.0*m**-3*mol 2000.0*m**-3*mol 3000.0*m**-3*mol]

That doesn't look too bad. It is a little clunky to have to import every unit, and it is clear the package is saving everything in SI units by default. Let us try to solve an equation.

Find the time that solves this equation. 

$0.01 = C_{A0} e^{-kt}$

First we solve without units. That way we know the answer.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

CA0 = 1.0  # mol/L
CA = 0.01  # mol/L
k = 1.0    # 1/s

def func(t):
    z = CA - CA0 * np.exp(-k*t)
    return z

t0 = 2.3

t, = fsolve(func, t0)
print 't = {0:1.2f} seconds'.format(t)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: t = 4.61 seconds


Now, with units. I note here that I tried the obvious thing of just importing the units, and adding them on, but the package is unable to work with floats that have units. For some functions, there must be an ndarray with units which is practically what the UnitScalar code below does. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve
from scimath.units.volume import liter
from scimath.units.substance import mol
from scimath.units.time import second
from scimath.units.api import has_units, UnitScalar

CA0 = UnitScalar(1.0, units = mol / liter)
CA = UnitScalar(0.01, units = mol / liter)
k = UnitScalar(1.0, units = 1 / second)

@has_units(inputs="t::units=s",
           outputs="result::units=mol/liter")
def func(t):
    z = CA - CA0 * float(np.exp(-k*t))
    return z

t0 = UnitScalar(2.3, units = second)

t, = fsolve(func, t0)
print 't = {0:1.2f} seconds'.format(t)
print type(t)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: t = 4.61 seconds
: <type 'numpy.float64'>

This is some heavy syntax that in the end does not preserve the units. In my Matlab package, we had to "wrap" many functions like fsolve so they would preserve units. Clearly this package will need that as well. Overall, in its current implementation this package does not do what I would expect all the time.[fn:1]



[fn:1] Then again no package does yet!

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
