#+TITLE: Syllabus for 06-625

* Course description - Chemical and Reactive Systems
This course will cover chemical kinetics and chemical reaction engineering with an emphasis on using computational tools to solve difficult problems. Topics will include reaction rates, stoichiometry, equilibrium and multiple reactions. Determination of rate law parameters and rate laws will be covered. Typical reactors including continuously stirred tank reactors, plug flow reactors and membrane reactors will be studied. The effects of heat and mass transfer on reactor design will be considered. Issues in catalysis will be presented and discussed. Students should expect to use numerical software extensively in the course.
